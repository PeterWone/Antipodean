We launched the drones. As the first arc of paint traced across the marble, Autumn piped up in my ear:

> _By the way, your penmanship is atrocious._

"It's called style."

> _If you say so, Brian._

If Bruce were here, he'd have drawn a giant saltshaker, underscored by the word OBEY! in letters three metres high. Subtlety was never his thing.

And if he was feeling ambitious, he'd hijack the broadcast TV feed. For a few glorious seconds, every screen in the country would flicker with a glitching Max Headroom, stuttering and morphing into a Dalek, the two voices alternating:

> _THE parliament are the SUPREME BEINGS. YOU WILL—_
> _YOU WILL OBEY!_

It would be the talk of the valley for weeks. And Bruce would never admit it was him.

But that was Bruce. I wasn't Bruce. I didn't want to just make them look ridiculous — I wanted people to internalise the grim truth. So after the laughter faded and the memes started, I made sure the next message was mine. No jokes, no pop culture, just a voice, clear and unadorned, cutting through the static:

"You are not powerless. They want you to believe obedience is safety, that compliance is virtue. But you are more than a subject. You are the reason they fear dissent. Remember that."

> _Sophia, nobody reads manifestos at 300 feet. If you want them to remember, keep it short. Like this: ON YOUR KNEES OR AT THEIR THROATS. One word, if you can manage it. KNEES._

For a moment, the city was silent. 

She sat on the corner of a building, like a caricature of Batman, and cried because she knew it wouldn't be enough. They could not survive a confrontation. The state was too big, too well resourced, and incapable of coexistence. She would strike first, and cripple it. Then strike again to kill it. 

And all those obedient little consumers would sit helpless in their cages. They wouldn't starve, they'd die of thirst, waiting for help that never came. She _knew_ what that would do to all those who depended on the system. 

There would be, _could_ be no coexistence. If she did not strike first, she would lose. Humanity would lose, as it had so many times. The state would _think_ itself the victor, and fall anyway. 

The tears slowed, and she wondered how so many people could be so wilfully blind. Then his voice was in her ear, calm and confident from beyond the grave, blaming no-one, pulling no punches. They _couldn't_ know. At first it _was_ better. For two generations after that, the diminishing returns were hidden in growth. By the time things went to shit nobody knew another way. All those failed civilisations must have been stupid, or warlike, or they didn't have our awesome tech. Nobody _wanted_ to know civilisation itself was the problem.

She reminded herself that if she _didn't_ act, if she and those in her care went quietly into that dark night, the state would fall anyway, and when it did it would be bigger, so _more_ people would suffer. She sighed deeply, despondent, and gazed out over the sea of lights.

"There but for the grace of a bad tempered old forester go I." 

The way out required an act of appalling cruelty and destruction. Her tears were not for herself, but for her unwitting, helpless victims. It helped that she hated them for killing him. She remembered the poster in his tiny office, covering the windowless end wall. His World Domination Plan. Step one: destroy world. Step two: build something better. Did he _know_ it would come to this? She started to laugh hysterically, voice lost in the black void, tears still falling.

She jumped off the building. The drones caught her. It was oddly freeing, not caring whether they did or not. As they accelerated, the wind made her eyes stream beyond the tears, and she tossed her head, helmet erupting from the collar of her suit. The roar of wind in her ears abated, and Autumn spoke as they left.

> _Did he ever tell you about his dog?_

"Is there anyone he _didn't_ tell? I wish a man had loved _me_ like that."

> _Did he tell you about the dreams?_

"I don't think so?"

> _He had nightmares, terrifying helpless immobility with a nameless dreadful void approaching to consume him. And every time, from the shadows a golden brown streak of rippling confidence and love and loyalty would erupt from the shadows and tear it to pieces._

She sniffled. "I can't imagine him being frightened of _anything_. Even when he knew he was going to die, he was calm and collected enough to send you to me."

> _He wasn't frightened of anything. He knew he wasn't alone. The dog was ten years gone, but it lived inside him, a beacon of strength and loyalty, and just plain being there when he needed a friend._

"I don't know what I think about that. Only remembering my best friend when I was terrified."

> _For him the dog was an inspiration. It knew no defeat. Not brave, indomitable. Forest saw in the dog all the qualities he believed a good man should have — loyalty, courage, steadfastness, and the simple act of being there when needed. It was in the dog that Forest first understood the nature of freedom. There was another dream, Sophia. Two, in fact. In one, Forest is a young man sitting on the stair of his mother's house in the warmth of the morning sun, arm hanging. A wet nose inside his hand and warm soft muscle leaning against his leg. He rolls his hand around the dog's head, tousling his ears, to rub his neck. Side by side they sit and watch the river in a precious moment that lasted fifty years._

Sophia sobbed. After a while she calmed and asked about the third dream.

> _He moved away from home for a job. No friends, no family. He was lonely. In his dream, the dog came to visit him. Forest was very confused. He asked, "How can you be here? You're dead." and the dog spoke: "I live on inside you, because you love me and you remember me. I will always be here when you need me." and then he walked back into the shadow behind the shed. Forest never dreamed of him again, but spoke of him often. He deliberately opened the door of every ear that would listen, that his friend might roam new fields. Including an immortal AI. I suspect I got every shred of detail he could muster. In a way I am honoured to be the keeper of so much love._

"Are you telling me he's not dead because he lives in me?"

> _Do you hear his voice, when the moment demands?_

She sniffed. "When don't I? The whole valley reeks of him."

> _Does he ever say anything new?_

Sophia stopped shuddering and turned inward.

"Sometimes, I think. How can that be?"

> _It's not magic, Sophia. Memory is a kind of software—adapted, updated, running on new hardware. You carry his instincts, his lessons, his warnings. When you act, you draw on what he left behind. That's not haunting; it's inheritance. Use it. Carry it with pride._
