Civilisation.

Hunter-gatherers, in clans, extended family, tribal and nomadic.

The invention of agriculture; man bending the world to his will, rather than adapting. 

Settled in place, few things threaten. What _can?_ We strive in concert, till our collective strength is geological in scale. With works of dam and road, on ever greater scale we master the wild and force it to submit.

And yet, without fail, we rise up! Only to fall again. And the night is long, as only those who dwell in it could truly tell.

_Why?_

We know why civilisation rises; it's obvious. A few good seasons, men band together and their strength multiplies. The only real threat is other men. But why is it inevitable that they fall again, they who are so mighty?

Egypt and Rome have fallen in their turn. China turned from the seas that might have carried it to world dominion. Yet nothing is completely forgotten, and empires rise from the ruins with ever increasing speed. Now we turn to the West, to civilizations born from the ashes of Rome itself.

## Episode 4: Europe - The Curse of Gold and the Burden of Success

### Part I: Spain - The Curse of Gold

*FADE IN: The port of Seville, 1540. Massive galleons unload chests of silver from the New World. The camera follows Spanish DOCKWORKERS straining under the weight of treasure that would bankrupt kingdoms.*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):** Never had any nation commanded such wealth as Spain in the sixteenth century. Silver from the mines of Potosí flowed across the Atlantic in quantities that defied imagination.

*SCENE: Counting house in Seville. MERCHANT RODRIGO MENDOZA examines ledgers with his ACCOUNTANT.*

**RODRIGO:** How much silver arrived on this fleet?

**ACCOUNTANT:** Forty-three tonnes, Don Rodrigo. More than all of Europe possessed a century ago.

**RODRIGO:** *(overwhelmed)* And the next fleet?

**ACCOUNTANT:** Twice as much. The mines produce faster than we can count.

*Cut to: Spanish nobleman's palace. COUNT FERNANDO DE ALBA dines in incredible luxury while SERVANTS attend his every need.*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):** Spanish nobles lived like Renaissance princes while their counterparts in France and England struggled to maintain modest estates.

*SCENE: The count's study. His STEWARD brings troubling news.*

**STEWARD:** My lord, the wheat harvest has failed again. The peasants require assistance.

**COUNT FERNANDO:** Buy grain from wherever it costs least. Dutch grain, French grain—what matter? We have silver enough to buy the world.

**STEWARD:** But my lord, perhaps we should encourage local farming, support our own—

**COUNT FERNANDO:** *(dismissive)* Why struggle with reluctant soil when American silver buys whatever we need? Let the Dutch farm. We shall count coins.

*Cut to: Spanish workshop, abandoned and dusty. Former CRAFTSMAN PABLO shows his son the empty looms.*

**PABLO:** Once, these looms produced the finest cloth in Christendom.

**SON:** What happened, Father?

**PABLO:** The silver happened. Why weave when you can buy cheaper cloth from Flanders? Why craft when you can purchase?

**SON:** But what shall we do for work?

**PABLO:** *(bitter)* Count coins, like everyone else. If there are any left to count.

*SCENE: Council chamber in Madrid, 1580. KING PHILIP II meets with his advisors. Maps cover the walls showing Spain's vast empire.*

**KING PHILIP II:** Our empire spans the globe. From the Philippines to Peru, from Milan to the Caribbean. How fare our dominions?

**COLONIAL MINISTER:** Majesty, the empire requires ever more officials. More governors, more tax collectors, more clerks to count the silver.

**TREASURY MINISTER:** The administrative costs grow yearly. Half the silver now goes to pay those who collect the other half.

**KING PHILIP II:** But surely the silver is sufficient?

**TREASURY MINISTER:** For now, Majesty. But what if the mines... falter?

**KING PHILIP II:** *(confident)* Impossible. God has blessed Spain with endless wealth. It is our divine right.

*SCENE: Peruvian silver mine, Potosí. Indigenous MINERS work in horrific conditions. SPANISH OVERSEER CAPTAIN GARCÍA surveys the operation.*

**CAPTAIN GARCÍA:** How much silver this month?

**MINE FOREMAN:** Less than last month, Captain. The easy veins are exhausted.

**CAPTAIN GARCÍA:** Then dig deeper. Work longer. Spain requires silver.

**MINE FOREMAN:** The workers are dying, sir. The mines are treacherous.

**CAPTAIN GARCÍA:** *(coldly)* Then bring more workers. The empire depends on silver, not on the lives of Indians.

*Cut to: Spanish Armada preparation, 1588. Ships being loaded with supplies. ADMIRAL SANTA CRUZ addresses his captains.*

**ADMIRAL SANTA CRUZ:** We sail to crush the English heretics. Our ships are magnificent, our cause divine.

**CAPTAIN MENDEZ:** Admiral, the English ships are smaller but faster. Their guns—

**ADMIRAL SANTA CRUZ:** Spanish gold has built the greatest fleet in history. What can English poverty accomplish against Spanish might?

**CAPTAIN MENDEZ:** But perhaps we should study their tactics, adapt our methods—

**ADMIRAL SANTA CRUZ:** Spain does not learn from pirates. Spain teaches lessons.

*Cut to: Aftermath of the Armada's defeat. Broken ships washing ashore on English beaches.*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):** The Armada's defeat shattered the myth of Spanish invincibility, but Spanish leaders could not understand why their gold had failed them.

*SCENE: Spanish court, 1598. KING PHILIP III (Philip II's son) meets with his advisors in a palace that still glitters with wealth.*

**NEW TREASURY MINISTER:** Majesty, the silver fleet was attacked by English pirates. Half the treasure is lost.

**KING PHILIP III:** Then send a larger fleet next year. Double the escort.

**NEW TREASURY MINISTER:** Sire, that will cost more than the silver we protect. And the mines report declining yields.

**KING PHILIP III:** *(frustrated)* How can this be? We own mountains of silver!

**ECONOMIC ADVISOR:** Your Majesty, perhaps we should develop other industries. The Dutch prosper through trade, the English through manufacturing—

**KING PHILIP III:** Spain does not copy lesser nations! We possess the wealth of the Indies!

*SCENE: Spanish textile workshop, 1620. Only a few looms remain operational. The former COUNT FERNANDO (now elderly) speaks with a DUTCH MERCHANT.*

**DUTCH MERCHANT:** I can offer you fine cloth at half the price of local production.

**COUNT FERNANDO:** *(aged and weary)* How is this possible? You have no silver mines.

**DUTCH MERCHANT:** We have something better—the knowledge of how to make wealth, not just spend it.

**COUNT FERNANDO:** But Spanish silver built this palace, this empire—

**DUTCH MERCHANT:** Spanish silver bought temporary glory. Dutch ingenuity builds lasting prosperity.

*The count looks around his decaying estate, understanding finally dawning.*

*SCENE: Spanish port, 1640. Far fewer ships arrive. DOCKWORKERS stand idle. The former merchant RODRIGO, now old and poor, speaks to his grandson.*

**RODRIGO:** Once, these docks groaned under the weight of treasure. Now look—emptiness.

**GRANDSON:** What happened to all the silver, Grandfather?

**RODRIGO:** We spent it all buying things we could have made ourselves. We bought the world, but forgot how to build it.

**GRANDSON:** Can we not begin again?

**RODRIGO:** *(sadly)* We forgot how. We taught our children to count coins, not to create value. Now the coins are gone, and we remember nothing else.

*SCENE: Final shot of Spain - abandoned silver works, empty ports, crumbling palaces. Camera focuses on a single remaining piece of silver, tarnished and forgotten.*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):** The silver that made Spain master of Europe became its undoing. Easy wealth bred easy assumptions—that prosperity would last forever, that learning was unnecessary when gold could buy anything, that strength came from possession rather than production. When the silver faded, Spain discovered it had forgotten how to create the very wealth it had so carelessly consumed.

### Part II: Britain - The Burden of Success

*FADE IN: Manchester textile mill, 1840. Steam-powered looms thunder in vast industrial halls. The camera follows MILL OWNER THOMAS ASHWORTH as he surveys his empire of iron and cotton.*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):** At its height, the British Empire governed a quarter of the world's population and controlled nearly a quarter of its land surface. The workshop of the world, Britain's factories clothed humanity while British ships carried British goods to markets their competitors could not reach.

*SCENE: Ashworth's office overlooking the mill floor. His FOREMAN brings production reports.*

**THOMAS ASHWORTH:** How many yards this week?

**FOREMAN:** Fifty thousand, sir. More than all of India produced in a year, before we arrived.

**THOMAS ASHWORTH:** And our orders?

**FOREMAN:** From Canada, Australia, India, Africa—the entire Empire wants Manchester cotton. We cannot keep pace with demand.

**THOMAS ASHWORTH:** *(confident)* Then we shall build more mills. British ingenuity has no limits.

*Cut to: London dock, same period. Massive ships unload goods from across the Empire. DOCKMASTER WILLIAM HARTLEY supervises the controlled chaos.*

**DOCKMASTER HARTLEY:** *(to his assistant)* Raw cotton from America, wool from Australia, tea from India, silk from China. The world's wealth flows through London.

**DOCK ASSISTANT:** And flows out again as finished goods, sir. British manufacturing leads the world.

**DOCKMASTER HARTLEY:** As it always shall. What foreigner can match British industry?

*SCENE: Colonial office, Whitehall, 1870. COLONIAL SECRETARY LORD CARNARVON meets with officials planning imperial administration.*

**LORD CARNARVON:** The Empire now spans four continents. How many administrators do we require?

**SENIOR CLERK:** At least ten thousand in India alone, my lord. Plus military garrisons, civil servants, judges, tax collectors—

**JUNIOR OFFICIAL:** The administrative costs grow yearly. Each new territory requires more bureaucrats than the last.

**LORD CARNARVON:** But surely the profits justify the expense?

**SENIOR CLERK:** For now, my lord. But the colonies increasingly require investment rather than providing returns.

**LORD CARNARVON:** *(dismissive)* Temporary adjustments. The Empire exists for Britain's benefit, not the reverse.

*SCENE: Ashworth's mill, 1880. THOMAS ASHWORTH (now elderly) meets with his son JAMES to discuss troubling news.*

**JAMES ASHWORTH:** Father, the German mills undercut our prices. Their new machinery produces cotton goods for half our cost.

**THOMAS ASHWORTH:** Impossible. British engineering is supreme.

**JAMES ASHWORTH:** Not anymore. They studied our methods, then improved them. Their workers are better trained, their managers more efficient.

**THOMAS ASHWORTH:** *(angry)* Germans? Learning from us? The students cannot surpass the masters!

**JAMES ASHWORTH:** But Father, perhaps we should modernize our own methods—

**THOMAS ASHWORTH:** These mills built the Empire! They need no improvement!

*Cut to: British steel works, Sheffield, 1890. STEELMAKER HENRY BESSEMER examines his furnaces with growing concern.*

**BESSEMER:** The Americans order less steel each month. Their own mills supply their needs.

**PLANT MANAGER:** And the Germans, sir. They've learned our techniques and bettered them.

**BESSEMER:** How is this possible? We invented modern steelmaking!

**PLANT MANAGER:** They sent students to learn from us, then returned home to build newer, better works. While we maintained our old methods, they innovated.

**BESSEMER:** *(bitter)* We taught them too well.

*SCENE: Colonial office, 1914. LORD GREY receives reports as World War I begins.*

**MILITARY ADVISOR:** My lord, defending the Empire requires forces on four continents. India, Africa, the Pacific, the Caribbean—

**LORD GREY:** What will this cost?

**TREASURY OFFICIAL:** More than the Empire earns, sir. The colonies that once enriched Britain now drain the treasury.

**LORD GREY:** But surely the Empire's resources—

**TREASURY OFFICIAL:** Must be developed with borrowed money, my lord. We borrow to govern what once governed itself.

*SCENE: Industrial boardroom, Birmingham, 1925. INDUSTRIALIST SIR ROBERT BALDWIN meets with his board as economic reports arrive.*

**SIR ROBERT:** Our markets shrink yearly. America, Germany, even Japan produce what we once supplied.

**BOARD MEMBER 1:** Perhaps we should invest in new technologies, new methods—

**SIR ROBERT:** With what capital? Half our profits go to maintain the colonies.

**BOARD MEMBER 2:** Then perhaps... perhaps we should reconsider the Empire's value?

**SIR ROBERT:** *(shocked)* Abandon the Empire? Britain IS the Empire!

**BOARD MEMBER 1:** But what if the Empire is now abandoning us?

*SCENE: House of Commons, 1945. PRIME MINISTER CLEMENT ATTLEE addresses Parliament as the reality of imperial decline becomes undeniable.*

**ATTLEE:** The war is won, but the cost... The Empire that once enriched Britain now impoverishes us.

**CONSERVATIVE MP:** Prime Minister, surely the colonies will recover, return to profitability—

**ATTLEE:** The colonies seek independence, not integration. India, Burma, Ceylon—all demand freedom from British rule.

**CONSERVATIVE MP:** But without the Empire, what is Britain?

**ATTLEE:** *(pause)* That, gentlemen, is what we must discover.

*SCENE: Final meeting in the same mill where we began. JAMES ASHWORTH (now elderly) speaks with a JAPANESE BUSINESSMAN who is purchasing the mill's machinery.*

**JAPANESE BUSINESSMAN:** We will ship these looms to Osaka. Japanese workers will operate what British workers built.

**JAMES ASHWORTH:** How did this happen? Britain led the world in manufacturing.

**JAPANESE BUSINESSMAN:** You taught us well. Then you stopped learning while we continued studying.

**JAMES ASHWORTH:** But we were the workshop of the world—

**JAPANESE BUSINESSMAN:** You were. Now you must discover what you shall become.

*Cut to: Modern London financial district. The camera shows gleaming towers where colonial offices once stood.*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):** By the time British leaders recognized the need for change, the moment for change had passed. The United States and Soviet Union had divided the world between them, leaving little room for traditional European empires.

*SCENE: Modern economist being interviewed in front of the defunct mill.*

**ECONOMIST:** *(to camera)* Britain's tragedy was the tragedy of success. The Empire that made them great became a burden they could not carry. The industries that led the world became museums they could not abandon.

**INTERVIEWER:** Could they have adapted?

**ECONOMIST:** Perhaps. But adaptation requires admitting that success is temporary. And that's the hardest lesson any civilization learns.

*Final shot: The sun setting over empty dock yards where British ships once carried the world's commerce.*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):** The sun had finally set on the British Empire, leaving its inheritors to discover that imperial glory and domestic prosperity were not the same thing. The burden of ruling the world had become heavier than the world's wealth could support. But into the power vacuum left by Europe's exhaustion, a new giant was stirring—one that would rise not by conquering the world's territories, but by conquering its ideas.
