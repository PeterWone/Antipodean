Villain's monologue

[after violently forcing uninvited entry to a session of parliament]
"I suppose you're all wondering why I've called you here today." Her voice resonated through the chamber, rich with harmonics, warm and clear but not loud. Almost in your ear. The sort of sound political campaigners dream of. She undid her hair and ..._bees_ flew out, three of them. The man who thought he saw it shook his head. They spread out like cameramen and hovered.

[confusion, possibly scattered laughter]
"What do the Roman Empire, you, and every other empire ever have in common?"

"Is this a joke?"

"In a sense, yes, a very bad one. But today it's a Socratic question."

"People? Cities?"

"Right but not central. Keep trying."

Autumn's presence drone flickered to life, but this time it was Forest's face and voice, large as life. You could almost smell oil and woodchips.

> _They centralised, and then they fell._
>
> _Centralisation is the crystal meth of societies. At first it's great, they're stronger, smarter, faster, more stamina._
>
> _And then they can't perform without it. The doses get bigger and bigger. Sicker and sicker, an ugly twisted mockery of what might have been. Brutal, untrustworthy and desperate._
>
> _And then a whole people dies._

"What do you want?"

"I want you to do what you promise: honour the social contract. You don't represent, you rule. But that's inevitable, you're as trapped in the endless cycle as the people you oppress."

"Who the fuck _are_ you?"

"Me? Once I was your pawn. But in a forest, I was queened." Her tone darkened. "Now, I am the Death of Shadows."

Her gaze swept the galleries. "I know what you did." She sighed heavily.

"I also know you can't help yourselves, but a warning is what he would have done." She gathered, drawing herself up, accusing gaze sweeping their eyes.

"We are not your thralls. What you are doing is slavery with lipstick. If people choose to submit, that is their prerogative, but if you try to force we who are free, defence will be pre-emptive."

She interrupted herself to glare at them.

"If you are worthy of the privilege you claim, you will tell them the truth. No more secrets. No more lies."

She paused, remembering her message. As though to herself, "Oh yes, the warning."

"You who love to centralise so that you may control... consider how vulnerable this makes you."

"For example..." Sophia raised a hand theatrically. Outside there was a terrific _CRUMP_ and the lights went out. Her departing footfalls were impossibly clear and confident in the padded dark. 

It was a hour before power returned. The lights did not. They shuffled out by the glow of cellphones. The water was off, too. Only to a small area, they discovered, which was itself a lesson in mercy; it would have been much easier to wreck the system.

In the wall by the main doors, glowing soft in the last light of day, a message graven deep into stone. It ran the length of the wall: "RULE NONE AND SUFFER NONE TO RULE" Beneath it, in an elegant hand _in stone,_ framed like an epigraph and attributed: "_I see everything you do, and it is my fate, my honour, my duty to be the Death of Shadows._"

They were still petulantly demanding answers when a streak of plasma sundered the heavens, deafened a city and left a two metre deep crater across the road outside the army stores at Wollstone. Apart from their ears, no-one was harmed, as though whoever did it knew exactly when the road was clear. Leaflets rained from a conspicuously empty sky.

James Cleary, MP, stopped sputtering and picked one up. It was stiff, fine paper, an odd, small size as though torn from a very expensive notebook. Unfolding it he found elegant copperplate handwriting, with a wax signet seal. He adjusted his glasses and squinted: around an ornate H were the same words graven in stone outside the chambers.

> Sorry about the mess, but apparently I didn't make myself clear. &mdash; _D of Sh_
