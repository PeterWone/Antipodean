Janna stalked across the yard, salt and pepper pigtails bouncing. She had a piglet under one arm and an axe in the other — though 'axe' hardly did it justice. A Protectorate cast-off, all humming edges and silly backlights, abandoned by Forest for the familiar heft of a chainsaw. Janna used it to chop wood. She didn’t look frightened — just deeply, righteously annoyed, like a Valkyrie with chores.

Children were changed profoundly by Janna’s domain. Drawn in by the siren call of dogs, chickens, ducks, geese, guinea fowl and pigs and enthralled by an endless parade of puppies, chicks, ducklings, goslings, keets and piglets, they found that time moved differently there. Slower and faster at once, the ticking of clocks dwarfed by titans of the skies; sun and stars and the phases of the moon. 

To be in her world had a price. She set them to work—feeding pigs, mucking out poultry runs, moving chicken tractors, potting cuttings, teaching them to marcott, to read the weather, to spot the first signs of blight or fox. Janna was filled with compassion and patience, and utterly without mercy. 

They were changed, and deeply, by brief eternities, life and death without end.

Unchanged, as she is: the cycle of life. That was why Forest liked her. Not that Janna would ever ask for help — she wouldn’t even think to. But once it finally got through Forest’s thick skull that there was a need, he solve the problem with whatever was at hand. In this case, stealth drones of alien make. Tiny, silent, armed, capable of hovering for days. The use of what the state saw as strategic assets to protect domestic poultry enraged the rulers from shadows, but Forest did as he saw fit. This is the prerogative of a Vanguard, chosen by alien not-gods for character and actions, not obedience. 

And today she was _vexed._

Quolls in the chickens.

Wallabies nipping all the buds from her saplings.

A visit from the tax department, who seemed very confused about how little they used money.

Now Antithesis were in her duck pond.

The dog-weed's triple jaw fell open, brushing the ground. It froze. Perhaps, mused the piglet, it could see the murder in her eyes. You could never tell. They lived and died in silence. Janna swung the axe and the smell of lawn clippings was everywhere. She threw it on an open fire where it sizzled and spat for a while, smoky at first before starting to burn.

She watched the flames catch, green and gold, as dusk deepened and the first fireflies blinked to life above the grass. The moon rose, lambent and watchful, painting the yard in silver and shadow. Janna stood silent, the piglet warm against her ribs, and let herself feel the weight of the day—regret for the taking, gratitude for the balance restored. The ashes, rich in potassium, would make good soap. She avoided thinking about where the fat would come from, not wanting to give the piglet bad dreams.
