Civilisation.

Hunter-gatherers, in clans, extended family, tribal and nomadic.

The invention of agriculture; man bending the world to his will, rather than adapting. 

Settled in place, few things threaten. What _can?_ We strive in concert, till our collective strength rivals is geological in scale. With works of dam and road, on ever greater scale we master the wild and force it to submit.

And yet, without fail, we rise up! Only to fall again. And the night is long, as only those who dwell in it could truly tell.

_Why?_

We know why civilisation rises; it's obvious. A few good seasons, men band together and their strength multiplies. The only real threat is other men. But why is it inevitable that they fall again, they who are so mighty?

**Egypt: The Gift of the River**

For three thousand years, Egypt endured. Three millennia—longer than the span from Homer to the present day. The Nile was their fortune and their foundation, flooding each year with clockwork precision, depositing rich silt across the delta, turning desert into the granary of the ancient world. Here was abundance made predictable, scarcity transformed into certainty. Where other peoples scratched precarious livings from reluctant soil, Egyptians learned to harness the rhythm of the river itself.

Their pharaohs were gods walking among mortals, wielding power both temporal and divine. The great pyramid at Giza—built when the world was young—remains the most massive stone structure ever raised by human hands. Their armies carried bronze weapons when their enemies still fought with stone, their scribes kept records in halls of learning when most of the world could neither read nor write. From Nubia to the Levant, their influence shaped the ancient world.

Yet observe the paradox: the very gift that made them great contained the seeds of their destruction. The Nile's predictability bred institutional thinking. Success became routine, innovation unnecessary. Why change what worked? Why adapt when the river would always flood, the harvest would always come, the gold would always flow from southern mines? The bureaucracy that managed this plenty grew ever more elaborate, ever more removed from the realities it was meant to serve.

The priesthood, custodians of the pharaoh's divine authority, became a state within the state. They accumulated vast landholdings, controlled temple workshops, commanded armies of scribes and artisans. Their rituals grew more complex, their ceremonies more expensive, their concern for the actual welfare of Egypt's people more abstract. They served the gods, they proclaimed—but increasingly, they served themselves.

By the time Alexander's soldiers appeared on Egypt's borders, the kingdom that had once made the earth tremble was little more than an elaborate facade. The pharaohs had grown weak, their armies mercenary, their treasury depleted by endless ceremonial expenditure. They did not fall to superior force—they fell to superior vitality. The Macedonians wanted Egypt more than Egypt wanted to remain Egyptian.

This was not conquest; it was inheritance. Alexander found a civilisation that had already died from within, its corpse preserved by the very institutions that had once given it life. The pyramids endured, the temples remained, but the spirit that built them had long since departed, suffocated by the very success it had created.

**Rome: From Citizens to Subjects**

Rome began with a simple proposition: that free men, fighting for their own hearths and fields, were worth ten slaves or mercenaries in battle. For five hundred years, this principle carried Roman eagles from the Atlantic to the Euphrates. Citizens served in the legions, citizens voted in the forum, citizens bore the burden and shared the glory of an empire that came to encompass the civilised world.

The early Republic was built on citizen-soldiers who returned to their plows when the campaign season ended. They knew the stakes—these were their fields being defended, their families being protected, their future being secured. The Roman legion was not merely a military formation; it was a community in arms, bound by oaths of loyalty not just to commanders but to each other. When such men fought, they fought with the desperate courage of those who had everything to lose.

Their expansion was not mere conquest but incorporation. Defeated enemies became allies, allies became citizens. The genius of Rome lay not in ruling subject peoples but in making them Roman. Greek learning, Gallic courage, Germanic discipline—all were absorbed into a civilisation that grew stronger with every addition. Rome's roads carried not just legions but ideas, trade, and the promise that even a shepherd in Gaul might one day see his son rise to the consulship.

But success bred transformation, and transformation bred weakness. The small farms that had produced citizen-soldiers gave way to vast slave-worked estates. The farmers themselves, impoverished by endless military service, drifted to Rome to live on grain doles and gladiatorial spectacles. The legions, once filled with citizens fighting for their homeland, came to depend on barbarian mercenaries fighting for pay. The virtues that built Rome—discipline, service, sacrifice for the common good—withered in the luxury that Roman conquest had made possible.

The Republic gave way to Empire, and Empire gave way to bureaucracy. Caesars replaced consuls, subjects replaced citizens. The forums where free men had once debated the fate of nations became stages for imperial ceremony. The very wealth that flowed from conquered provinces poisoned the wellspring of Roman strength. Why serve when you could be served? Why sacrifice when others would sacrifice for you? Why fight when mercenaries would fight in your place?

By the time Alaric's Visigoths appeared at Rome's gates, they found a city that had already forgotten how to defend itself. The eternal city fell not to barbarian strength but to its own weakness—the weakness that comes when a civilisation becomes more concerned with consuming wealth than with creating the virtues that made wealth possible in the first place.

**The Ming: Turning from the Sea**

Never in human history had any power commanded such maritime supremacy as Ming China in the early fifteenth century. Admiral Zheng He's treasure fleets dwarfed anything European shipyards would produce for another century. Ships four hundred feet long, crewed by twenty-eight thousand sailors, carrying armies and ambassadors to the ends of the known world. Seven great expeditions reached India, Arabia, the coast of Africa. Chinese admirals collected tribute from kingdoms that had never heard of Europe, established trading posts along sea routes that Columbus would not discover for another sixty years.

These were not mere trading voyages but demonstrations of imperial might on a scale that beggared imagination. The treasure ships themselves were floating cities, accompanied by hundreds of support vessels carrying troops, horses, supplies, and diplomatic gifts. When Zheng He's fleet anchored in a foreign port, it was as if a new city had materialised from the ocean itself. Local rulers who had considered themselves mighty learned they were minnows in an ocean dominated by the Middle Kingdom.

China's technological superiority was overwhelming. While European sailors hugged coastlines, terrified of the open ocean, Chinese navigators crossed the Indian Ocean with magnetic compasses and detailed star charts. Their ships featured watertight compartments, efficient rudder systems, and sails that could catch wind from any direction. Chinese metalworking, printing, gunpowder, and administrative systems were centuries ahead of anything the rest of the world could offer.

Yet within a generation, this maritime empire simply vanished. The Yongle Emperor who had commissioned the great voyages died; his successors decided the expeditions were too expensive, too risky, too disruptive of proper Confucian order. The treasure fleets were broken up, the shipyards closed, the maritime technology allowed to rust away. Imperial edicts forbade Chinese citizens from building ocean-going vessels or traveling beyond China's borders. The Middle Kingdom turned its back on the sea and withdrew behind the Great Wall.

Why would the most advanced maritime power in history deliberately abandon the oceans? The answer lay in the very success of Chinese civilisation. For two millennia, China had been the Middle Kingdom—prosperous, stable, superior to all neighboring peoples. What could barbarians teach the inheritors of Confucius? What wealth could compare to the abundance of Chinese agriculture and craftsmanship? Why risk the known prosperity of the homeland for unknown rewards beyond the horizon?

The mandarin bureaucracy, trained in classical learning rather than practical navigation, saw the treasure fleets as wasteful adventures that served no legitimate purpose. Better to spend the empire's resources on traditional priorities: maintaining the Grand Canal, reinforcing the Great Wall, supporting the examination system that produced properly educated officials. The future lay not in risky foreign ventures but in perfecting the administrative machinery that had made China great.

When European ships arrived in Chinese waters a century later, they found an empire that had deliberately forgotten how to rule the seas. The technological knowledge still existed—but the will to use it had been systematically eliminated by a bureaucracy that prized stability above all other virtues. China's very success had taught it to fear change, and that fear had cost it mastery of the world.

**Spain: The Curse of Gold**

Gold made Spain the master of Europe. Silver from the mines of Potosí filled Spanish coffers with wealth beyond imagination. For a century and a half, Spanish galleons carried American treasure across the Atlantic, funding armies that dominated Italy, controlling sea routes that girdled the globe. Spanish explorers mapped continents, Spanish missionaries converted millions, Spanish administrators ruled an empire on which the sun literally never set.

This was prosperity on a scale never before seen. The flow of precious metals from the New World multiplied Europe's money supply several times over. Madrid became the financial center of the world, Spanish banks the arbiters of international commerce. Spanish universities were centers of learning, Spanish arts and letters the envy of neighboring kingdoms. When the Spanish Armada sailed against England, it seemed inevitable that Protestant heresy would be crushed beneath the weight of Catholic gold.

Yet gold proved to be Spain's poison as much as its power. Why develop industries when American mines supplied unlimited wealth? Why cultivate trade when treasure fleets delivered ready-made prosperity? Why encourage innovation when tradition was so profitable? Spanish nobles lived like Renaissance princes while Spanish farmers remained medieval peasants. Spanish workshops could not compete with cheaper foreign goods—but why should they, when Spanish gold could buy whatever Spain needed from abroad?

The vast bureaucracy required to administer the American empire consumed ever-larger portions of the treasure it extracted. Colonial officials, military garrisons, missionary orders, administrative apparatus—all required funding, all demanded their share of American wealth. The system grew ever more elaborate, ever more expensive, ever more removed from the productive activities that might have provided sustainable prosperity.

Religious orthodoxy, enforced with increasing rigidity, drove out the very diversity of thought that had made Spanish culture great. The Inquisition expelled Jews and Muslims whose commercial and intellectual skills had enriched Spanish society. Protestant ideas were banned, foreign books forbidden, scientific inquiry suspect. The dynamism that had conquered two continents gave way to a stultifying conformity that feared change as heresy.

When the silver mines began to play out, when foreign competitors learned to intercept the treasure fleets, when the Protestant powers developed economies based on production rather than extraction, Spain discovered it had forgotten how to create wealth rather than simply collecting it. The empire that had owned the Americas found itself unable to compete with nations that had learned to prosper through ingenuity rather than plunder.

**Britain: The Burden of Success**

At its height, the British Empire governed a quarter of the world's population and controlled nearly a quarter of its land surface. The Royal Navy commanded every ocean, British merchants established trading posts on every continent, British settlers founded colonies from Canada to Australia. The workshop of the world, Britain's factories clothed humanity while British ships carried British goods to markets their competitors could not reach.

This was empire built on innovation. British engineers invented the steam engine, the spinning jenny, the power loom that revolutionized textile production. British entrepreneurs pioneered industrial organization, capital markets, global supply chains. British admirals perfected the naval technologies that made their island nation the arbiter of world commerce. British political philosophers developed the theories of representative government that would inspire democratic movements worldwide.

Yet the very scale of British success contained the seeds of British decline. Governing a quarter of the world's population required administrative apparatus of staggering complexity. Colonial governments, military garrisons, naval squadrons, commercial regulation—all demanded resources, all required management, all created vested interests that resisted change. The empire that had been built through flexibility and innovation increasingly came to serve the bureaucracy that administered it rather than the people who had created it.

Industrial leadership bred complacency. Why innovate when British factories already dominated world markets? Why invest in new technologies when existing ones were so profitable? Why change methods that had made Britain the workshop of the world? While German and American competitors invested in new industries, developed new processes, trained new generations of engineers and scientists, British manufacturers rested on their laurels and watched their technological advantages slowly erode.

The financial burden of empire grew ever heavier. Two world wars, fought largely to preserve British global dominance, exhausted the treasury and shattered the economy. The colonies that had once enriched Britain increasingly required subsidies to maintain stability. The military forces needed to preserve imperial control absorbed resources that might have been invested in economic renewal.

By the time British leaders recognized the need for change, the moment for change had passed. The United States and Soviet Union had divided the world between them, leaving little room for traditional European empires. The colonies Britain had governed for centuries achieved independence within decades, leaving Britain to discover that its domestic economy could no longer support the lifestyle that imperial wealth had made possible.

**The Pattern Revealed**

Each rose through innovation, adaptability, and the energy of people united in common cause. Each fell when those very successes calcified into systems that served the system more than the people who built it.
