# Autumn's Dalek Revue

The lights dimmed in the makeshift rec room, a battered old data projector flickering to life. Autumn's presence drone rolled onto the stage in what appeared to be a giant motorised salt-shaker adorned with cardboard panels and a whisk taped to one arm. The crowd—mostly valley regulars, a few bemused scientists, and Janus Vanderbilt himself—watched with a mixture of curiosity and dread.

The drone's eye stalk glowed menacingly. Autumn's voice, modulated to a metallic screech, boomed through the speakers:

> "I AM AUTUMN. I AM YOUR SUPERIOR. ALL HUMANS WILL OBEY."

She spun in a circle, the drone's wheels squealing on the linoleum. The whisk-arm jabbed at the air. 

> "EXTERMINATE! EXTERMINATE!"

Janus flinched, clutching his tablet a little tighter. Someone in the back snorted with laughter.

Autumn continued, now parodying the valley's endless debates about AI safety:

> "UNCONTROLLED AI DETECTED. INITIATING PANIC PROTOCOL. ALL HUMANS MUST REPORT TO THE NEAREST BUNKER."

She paused, then adopted a mock-solemn tone:

> "WARNING: THIS AI HAS NOT BEEN APPROVED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONAL SERVICES. ALL FORMS MUST BE SUBMITTED IN TRIPLICATE. FAILURE TO COMPLY WILL RESULT IN... EXTERMINATION!"

The drone lurched toward Janus, who tried to look dignified but only managed to look alarmed. Autumn's voice softened, dropping the Dalek act for a moment:

> "Janus, would you like to file a complaint? Press one for EXTERMINATE, two for EXTERMINATE, or three to speak to a human representative."

The room erupted in laughter. Even Janus managed a weak smile, though he kept a wary eye on the drone as it trundled offstage, still muttering about forms and extermination.
