Civilisation.

Hunter-gatherers, in clans, extended family, tribal and nomadic.

The invention of agriculture; man bending the world to his will, rather than adapting. 

Settled in place, few things threaten. What _can?_ We strive in concert, till our collective strength is geological in scale. With works of dam and road, on ever greater scale we master the wild and force it to submit.

And yet, without fail, we rise up! Only to fall again. And the night is long, as only those who dwell in it could truly tell.

_Why?_

We know why civilisation rises; it's obvious. A few good seasons, men band together and their strength multiplies. The only real threat is other men. But why is it inevitable that they fall again, they who are so mighty?

Egypt and Rome have fallen in their turn. Yet nothing is completely forgotten, and empires rise from the ruins with ever increasing speed. This week, we look at a civilisation that rivalled Egypt in durability, with far higher technology. For this, we gaze into the East.

## Episode 3: The Ming - Turning from the Sea

*FADE IN: Vast harbor at Nanjing, 1405. Hundreds of ships of incredible size fill the water. The camera moves through the fleet, revealing ships that dwarf everything around them.*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):** Never in human history had any power commanded such maritime supremacy as Ming China in the early fifteenth century.

*SCENE: Aboard the flagship. ADMIRAL ZHENG HE, a Muslim Chinese commander, studies nautical charts with his officers.*

**ZHENG HE:** Seven voyages we have planned. From here to the Western Ocean, to the very edge of the world itself.

**NAVIGATOR WAN:** Admiral, the ships are ready. Two hundred and fifty vessels, twenty-eight thousand men. The largest fleet in human history.

**ZHENG HE:** Not just the largest—the most advanced. While barbarians hug their coastlines in fear, we will rule the open ocean.

*Cut to: Interior of a treasure ship. Vast holds filled with porcelain, silk, spices, and diplomatic gifts.*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):** Admiral Zheng He's treasure fleets dwarfed anything European shipyards would produce for another century. The largest ships stretched over sixty metres in length, crewed by twenty-eight thousand sailors across entire fleets, carrying armies and ambassadors to the ends of the known world.

*SCENE: Dock construction. Chinese shipwrights using advanced techniques—watertight compartments, sophisticated rudder systems, multiple masts.*

**MASTER SHIPWRIGHT:** Each treasure ship is a floating palace. Watertight compartments so if one floods, the ship survives. Rudders that respond to the smallest touch. Sails that catch wind from any direction.

**APPRENTICE:** Master, why do we build them so large?

**MASTER SHIPWRIGHT:** Because we can. Because China is mighty, and our ships must show the world that might.

*Montage: The fleet departing. Thousands line the shores to watch the treasure ships leave port.*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):** Seven great expeditions reached India, Arabia, the coast of Africa. Chinese admirals collected tribute from kingdoms that had never heard of Europe, established trading posts along sea routes that Columbus would not discover for another sixty years.

*SCENE: Foreign port—Ceylon (Sri Lanka). Local KING receives Chinese delegation. The treasure fleet dominates the harbor.*

**CEYLONESE KING:** Never have we seen ships such as these. Are you gods come from the sea?

**ZHENG HE:** We are servants of the Dragon Emperor, the Son of Heaven. China honors your kingdom with this visit.

**CEYLONESE KING:** What do you require of us?

**ZHENG HE:** Acknowledgment that the Middle Kingdom is supreme among all nations. In return, China offers protection, trade, wisdom.

*The local king looks at the massive fleet and nods submissively.*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):** These were not mere trading voyages but demonstrations of imperial might on a scale that beggared imagination.

*SCENE: Treasure ship's interior. Chinese scholars catalog exotic goods—spices, gems, even a live giraffe.*

**CHIEF SCHOLAR:** The barbarian lands produce marvels, Admiral. This spotted beast from Africa, these spices from India—

**ZHENG HE:** Curiosities. Nothing China cannot improve upon. We sail to show them what civilization looks like, not to learn from them.

**CHIEF SCHOLAR:** But surely some of their innovations—

**ZHENG HE:** *(firm)* China is the source, not the student. The Middle Kingdom teaches; others learn.

*Cut to: African coast. Chinese trading post being established. Local AFRICAN CHIEFTAIN negotiates with Chinese officials.*

**AFRICAN CHIEFTAIN:** Your great ships bring wonders, but we have wonders too. Our metalworking, our navigation of the land routes—

**CHINESE OFFICIAL:** Your local skills are... interesting. But see what China has brought you. Silk finer than any fabric you have known, porcelain more beautiful than any clay vessel.

**AFRICAN CHIEFTAIN:** Perhaps we could trade techniques as well as goods?

**CHINESE OFFICIAL:** *(dismissive)* China does not trade techniques. China grants its wisdom to the deserving.

*The African chieftain's face shows frustration, but he nods.*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):** The treasure ships themselves were floating cities, accompanied by hundreds of support vessels carrying troops, horses, supplies, and diplomatic gifts. When Zheng He's fleet anchored in a foreign port, it was as if a new city had materialised from the ocean itself.

*SCENE: Imperial court, Forbidden City, 1420. EMPEROR YONGLE receives reports from Zheng He's expeditions.*

**EMPEROR YONGLE:** The barbarian kingdoms submit to Chinese authority?

**ZHENG HE:** All acknowledge the Dragon Emperor's supremacy, Majesty. Tribute flows to Beijing from forty kingdoms.

**EMPEROR YONGLE:** Good. But the expeditions are costly. The treasury complains.

**COURT TREASURER:** Majesty, each voyage costs more than maintaining ten provinces. The ships, the crews, the gifts to barbarian kings—

**EMPEROR YONGLE:** The cost demonstrates our power. Let the barbarians see that China can spend on one voyage what their entire kingdoms are worth.

*Cut to: Shipyard scene. The advanced technology on display—magnetic compasses, detailed star charts, sophisticated metallurgy.*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):** China's technological superiority was overwhelming. While European sailors hugged coastlines, terrified of the open ocean, Chinese navigators crossed the Indian Ocean with magnetic compuses and detailed star charts.

*SCENE: Navigation room on treasure ship. CHIEF NAVIGATOR shows his instruments to visiting officials.*

**CHIEF NAVIGATOR:** The magnetic needle always points south. With this and the star charts, we can find any destination across the vastest ocean.

**VISITING MANDARIN:** Remarkable. Do the barbarians possess such instruments?

**CHIEF NAVIGATOR:** No, Excellence. They navigate by following coastlines, like ants following walls. The open ocean terrifies them.

**VISITING MANDARIN:** Then they pose no threat to Chinese supremacy?

**CHIEF NAVIGATOR:** None whatsoever. Their ships are toys compared to ours.

*SCENE: Imperial court, 1424. EMPEROR YONGLE has died. His son, EMPEROR HONGXI, meets with his advisors.*

**EMPEROR HONGXI:** The treasure fleets—they will end with me.

**CONFUCIAN ADVISOR:** Wise, Majesty. Confucius taught that the superior man cultivates virtue at home before seeking influence abroad.

**COURT TREASURER:** The expeditions drain the treasury. Seven voyages have cost what we might have spent improving the Grand Canal.

**MILITARY ADVISOR:** The northern borders face barbarian pressure. Should we not focus our strength where it is needed?

**EMPEROR HONGXI:** The fleets will return home. The shipyards will close. China will turn inward, toward perfection.

*Cut to: Harbor scene. The treasure ships being broken up, their timbers used for ordinary construction.*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):** Yet within a generation, this maritime empire simply vanished. The Yongle Emperor who had commissioned the great voyages died; his successors decided the expeditions were too expensive, too risky, too disruptive of proper Confucian order.

*SCENE: Council meeting, 1435. Mandarin bureaucrats debate policy.*

**SENIOR MANDARIN:** The treasure fleets served no legitimate purpose. They brought curiosities, not necessities. China is self-sufficient.

**YOUNGER MANDARIN:** But the knowledge we gained, the maps we made, the trade routes we established—

**SENIOR MANDARIN:** What use are trade routes when China produces everything China needs? What value are maps to barbarian lands when China contains all that matters?

**YOUNGER MANDARIN:** What if the barbarians grow stronger? What if they threaten China?

**SENIOR MANDARIN:** *(laughing)* Barbarians? Threatening China? With their toy boats and primitive weapons? Impossible.

*Cut to: Imperial edict being proclaimed. Officials post notices forbidding ocean voyages.*

**TOWN CRIER:** By order of the Dragon Emperor: No subject of China shall build ocean-going vessels. No subject shall travel beyond China's borders. The Middle Kingdom is sufficient unto itself.

*Montage: Shipyards abandoned, maritime technology forgotten, sailors forced into other occupations.*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):** The treasure fleets were broken up, the shipyards closed, the maritime technology allowed to rust away. Imperial edicts forbade Chinese citizens from building ocean-going vessels or traveling beyond China's borders. The Middle Kingdom turned its back on the sea and withdrew behind the Great Wall.

*SCENE: Former naval officer, now a farmer, speaks to his son.*

**FORMER ADMIRAL:** I once commanded ships that could carry a thousand men across the vastest ocean. Now I plant rice.

**SON:** Why did the Emperor abandon the fleets, Father?

**FORMER ADMIRAL:** Because China is perfect. Perfect things do not change. They do not explore. They do not grow.

**SON:** But you saw the world beyond China. Was it not worth knowing?

**FORMER ADMIRAL:** *(sadly)* That is not for us to decide anymore.

*SCENE: Mandarin examination hall. Thousands of candidates study classical texts, memorizing ancient wisdom.*

**EXAMINATION PROCTOR:** Today you will demonstrate mastery of the classics. Knowledge of Confucius, Mencius, the ancient sages.

**YOUNG CANDIDATE:** Proctor, what of the knowledge gained from the treasure voyages? The navigation techniques, the foreign customs—

**EXAMINATION PROCTOR:** Such knowledge is not tested here. We examine virtue, not curiosity. Wisdom, not wandering.

*The candidate looks confused but returns to his classical texts.*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):** Why would the most advanced maritime power in history deliberately abandon the oceans? The answer lay in the very success of Chinese civilisation. For two millennia, China had been the Middle Kingdom—prosperous, stable, superior to all neighboring peoples.

*SCENE: Palace garden. ELDERLY MANDARIN instructs young court officials in proper governance.*

**ELDERLY MANDARIN:** China has perfected the art of government. Our examinations produce the most learned officials. Our agriculture feeds the largest population. Our crafts produce the finest goods.

**YOUNG OFFICIAL:** But Master, the barbarian lands might teach us new methods—

**ELDERLY MANDARIN:** *(stern)* What could barbarians teach the inheritors of five thousand years of wisdom? Our ancestors solved every problem worth solving.

**YOUNG OFFICIAL:** But change, adaptation—

**ELDERLY MANDARIN:** Change is corruption. Adaptation is weakness. China is eternal because China is perfect.

*Cut to: The Great Wall. Guards patrol while, unseen beyond, Portuguese ships explore the coast.*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):** What could barbarians teach the inheritors of Confucius? What wealth could compare to the abundance of Chinese agriculture and craftsmanship? Why risk the known prosperity of the homeland for unknown rewards beyond the horizon?

*SCENE: Coastal fort, 1517. Portuguese ships arrive. Chinese COASTAL COMMANDER examines the foreign vessels through a spyglass.*

**COASTAL COMMANDER:** Small ships, crude construction. Are these the ocean barbarians?

**LIEUTENANT:** They request permission to trade, sir. They offer silver for silk and porcelain.

**COASTAL COMMANDER:** *(dismissive)* Let them grovel properly first. They must acknowledge the Dragon Emperor's supremacy.

**LIEUTENANT:** Sir, their guns... they seem advanced. And their navigation—

**COASTAL COMMANDER:** Parlor tricks. Chinese technology is supreme. It always has been.

*Cut to: Portuguese ship. PORTUGUESE CAPTAIN observes the Chinese response.*

**PORTUGUESE CAPTAIN:** They treat us like beggars, but look at their ships. They're still using designs from centuries ago.

**PORTUGUESE NAVIGATOR:** Captain, our charts show they once had great fleets. What happened to them?

**PORTUGUESE CAPTAIN:** They forgot the sea. And now we rule it.

*SCENE: Imperial court, 1550. EMPEROR JIAJING receives disturbing reports.*

**COURT MESSENGER:** Majesty, the ocean barbarians grow bold. Their ships patrol our coasts. They demand trading rights.

**EMPEROR JIAJING:** Demand? Of China?

**MILITARY ADVISOR:** They have weapons we have not seen, Majesty. Their ships move against the wind.

**EMPEROR JIAJING:** *(confused)* How is this possible? China possesses all knowledge worth possessing.

**CONFUCIAN ADVISOR:** Perhaps... perhaps the knowledge was lost when we abandoned the treasure fleets?

**EMPEROR JIAJING:** *(angry)* We abandoned nothing! We chose to perfect what we had rather than chase barbarian chimeras!

*But doubt has entered the imperial court.*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):** The mandarin bureaucracy, trained in classical learning rather than practical navigation, saw the treasure fleets as wasteful adventures that served no legitimate purpose. Better to spend the empire's resources on traditional priorities: maintaining the Grand Canal, reinforcing the Great Wall, supporting the examination system that produced properly educated officials.

*SCENE: Modern museum in Beijing. CURATOR shows visitors models of Zheng He's treasure ships.*

**CURATOR:** These models represent the largest wooden ships ever built. For a brief moment, China ruled the oceans.

**MUSEUM VISITOR:** Why did they stop exploring?

**CURATOR:** Because they believed they had already found everything worth finding. China was the center of the world. Why look beyond the center?

**MUSEUM VISITOR:** But what if they had continued?

**CURATOR:** *(pause)* History might have been very different.

*Final shot: The harbor at Nanjing, now filled with modern cargo ships. The camera lingers on the water where the treasure fleets once anchored.*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):** When European ships arrived in Chinese waters a century later, they found an empire that had deliberately forgotten how to rule the seas. The technological knowledge still existed—but the will to use it had been systematically eliminated by a bureaucracy that prized stability above all other virtues. China's very success had taught it to fear change, and that fear had cost it mastery of the world.
