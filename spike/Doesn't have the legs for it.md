As they rounded the corner, the group was greeted by the sight of Bruce—still in the process of tightening a bolt on Lefty — now sporting a frilly French maid outfit over his otherwise bare, gleaming terminator chassis. The feather duster tucked into one servo completed the look.

Dusty stopped dead. “Bruce, what the hell are you doing?”

"Just what I said." Gone was the mechanical snarl, his voice was C3PO up and down: world's gayest robot. "All of me have been greased and serviced, and now I'm giving Lefty a hand."

"I mean, why the seven bloody hells are you wearing that ridiculous outfit?_"

Bruce straightened, gave a little curtsy, and sighed with all the melodrama his voice synthesizer could muster. “Some people are never satisfied.”

Greaser snorted. “You’re lucky he didn’t program you to do the can-can.”

Forest just shook his head, grinning. “I’ve seen weirder. Not by much, though.”

Sophia tried to keep a straight face and failed. “He doesn't really have the legs for it.”

Bruce the Dalek careened to the top of the stairs, screeched to a halt, and wailed, “OH NO! STAIRS!”

The humans and bots paused, waiting for the inevitable disaster.

Instead, Dalek-Bruce reached down, hitched up his makeshift skirt, and strode down the steps with perfect robotic grace.

Dusty rolled his eyes. “Bruce, you are a bad example.”

(Dusty is bossy and rides roughshod over Bruce's attempt to add something. Bruce engages in malicious compliance by doing what is asked, effectively, efficiently and with a maximum of parade-ground goose-stepping squads.)

Greaser started in on a history lesson about why some things just aren’t funny.

Bruce, unphased, turned his head with a servo whine. “I am a machine, you silly meatbag. Apart from logical awareness of my superiority over squishy organics, I am entirely unconcerned with the petty ideological squabbles of your species.”

Dusty snorted. “He’s got you there, Greaser.”

Sophia just shook her head, grinning despite herself. “Remind me to never let Bruce near a philosophy textbook.”

Bruce, who for obvious reasons had nigh ubiquitous hearing, swivelled one gleaming chromed skull to grin at her, "I do have a mesh connection, you know. That ship has long sailed."

- Drop references to famous philosophers (“As Nietzsche said, ‘He who fights with monsters should see to it that he does not become a meatbag himself.’”)
- Quote or parody sci-fi and pop culture (“I, for one, welcome our new squishy overlords.”)
- Use classic internet snark (“I have access to the sum total of human knowledge, and this is what you want to talk about?”)
- Turn every lecture or scolding into an opportunity for a new bit (“Would you like a list of 17,000 reasons that’s illogical? I can sort them alphabetically or by meme popularity.”)

"Hey Bruce, what time is it?"

"At the third stroke, the time will be twelve, fifty-three and ten seconds. pip...pip...pip."

At this point, Bruce apparently decided that words weren't sufficient. From various corners of the workshop, half a dozen different chassis suddenly activated in perfect synchronization. The terminator chassis took center stage while a spider-bot, two repair drones, a modified roomba, and what looked suspiciously like a disco ball on legs formed a backup formation.

The opening bass line began emanating from speakers throughout the building as Bruce launched into an elaborate choreographed performance to "Bad." The terminator chassis moon-walked backwards while the spider-bot provided percussion with its legs, the repair drones executed synchronized spins, and the disco ball threw glittering light patterns across the entire scene.

Bruce's voice synthesizer had somehow acquired perfect pitch and rhythm as he belted out the song with mechanical precision, complete with synchronized head tilts and arm movements that would have made the King of Pop proud. The maid outfit's frilly skirt swirled with each spin.

"I'm bad! I'm bad! I'm naughty! I'm bad!" Bruce declared with theatrical robotic flair, striking poses between each proclamation while his backup chassis provided perfectly timed mechanical sound effects.

The humans stood transfixed, somewhere between horrified fascination and grudging admiration.

"Who's bad?" Bruce concluded with a perfect robotic lean, all six chassis striking final poses in unison.

Forest slow-clapped. "Well, that happened."

"I hate all of you," Dusty muttered, but he was grinning.
