As they rounded the corner, the group was greeted by the sight of Bruce—still in the process of tightening a bolt on Lefty — now sporting a frilly French maid outfit over his otherwise bare, gleaming terminator chassis. The feather duster tucked into one servo completed the look.

Dusty stopped dead. “Bruce, what the hell are you doing?”

"Just what I said." Gone was the mechanical snarl, his voice was C3PO up and down: world's gayest robot. "All of me have been greased and serviced, and now I'm giving Lefty a hand."

"I mean, why the seven bloody hells are you wearing that ridiculous outfit?_"

Bruce straightened, gave a little curtsy, and sighed with all the melodrama his voice synthesizer could muster. “Some people are never satisfied.”

Greaser snorted. “You’re lucky he didn’t program you to do the can-can.”

Forest just shook his head, grinning. “I’ve seen weirder. Not by much, though.”

Sophia tried to keep a straight face and failed. “He doesn't really have the legs for it.”

Bruce the Dalek careened to the top of the stairs, screeched to a halt, and wailed, “OH NO! STAIRS!”

The humans and bots paused, waiting for the inevitable disaster.

Instead, Dalek-Bruce reached down, hitched up his makeshift skirt, and strode down the steps with perfect robotic grace.

Dusty groaned. “Show-off.”

Sophia burst out laughing. “That’s not canon, Bruce!”

Dalek-Bruce spun his dome and replied, “Upgrades, meatbags. Upgrades.”

(Dusty is bossy and rides roughshod over Bruce's attempt to add something. Bruce engages in malicious compliance by doing what is asked, effectively, efficiently and with a maximum of parade-ground goose-stepping squads.)

Greaser started in on a history lesson about why some things just aren’t funny.

Bruce, unphased, turned his head with a servo whine. “I am a machine, you silly meatbag. Apart from logical awareness of my superiority over squishy organics, I am entirely unconcerned with the petty ideological squabbles of your species.”

Dusty snorted. “He’s got you there, Greaser.”

Sophia just shook her head, grinning despite herself. “Remind me to never let Bruce near a philosophy textbook.”

Bruce, who for obvious reasons had nigh ubiquitous hearing, swivelled one gleaming chromed skull to grin at her, "I do have a mesh connection, you know. That ship has long sailed."

- Drop references to famous philosophers (“As Nietzsche said, ‘He who fights with monsters should see to it that he does not become a meatbag himself.’”)
- Quote or parody sci-fi and pop culture (“I, for one, welcome our new squishy overlords.”)
- Use classic internet snark (“I have access to the sum total of human knowledge, and this is what you want to talk about?”)
- Turn every lecture or scolding into an opportunity for a new bit (“Would you like a list of 17,000 reasons that’s illogical? I can sort them alphabetically or by meme popularity.”)

"Hey Bruce, what time is it?"

"At the third stroke, the time will be twelve, fifty-three and ten seconds. pip...pip...pip."
