"Now you know why they call us the Vanguard."

"We?"

"You're here, aren't you?"

"Vanguards have space guns and magic medicine."

He handed her an M40-AR.

"And body armour that works."

"Autumn, we have about thirty minutes before we put down. I think it's time you took the lady shopping."

> _It would be my pleasure._
>
> _Sophia, I'm going to hijack your augs, if you've never experienced full immersion you might want to sit down first._

Sophia sat, and Autumn gave her some privacy by isolating her headset. Fifteen minutes later Autumn announced a spend of 1209 points. Forest nodded. Boxes appeared in Sophia's lap and her whole face lit up as she opened it.

Forest stopped rubbernecking the unboxing when Autumn piped up.

> _What happened to "I want to fly my attack helicopter"?_

"The disappointing thing, Autumn, is that he's more interested in my new toys than watching me undress."

He snorted, because it was true.

Five minutes later, "Come on, tiger, check out the goodies." She put one hand on the top of the bubble and mock twirled. "Supple but shock-stiff, with magnets for weapons and magazines.

"Autumn," he subvocalised, "Why have you dressed her up as Black Widow?"

"What's wrong?" fretted Sophia, "Do I look silly?"

"No, you look hot. Distractingly hot. Think Black Widow. Frankly, I think Autumn did it on purpose."

"Oh, really?" she preened, unconsciously taking a deep breath. She channelled the primness of her inner Karen, bleeding unexpected tension out of the air. Relaxing, she smiled again: "Check this out!" She tossed her head like a shampoo model showing off her mane, and a full-face helmet erupted from the high collar.

He chuckled, "Now you look like Spiderman."

He put them on the ground. Not so deftly as Oleksiy might have, but a far cry from the bouncing roughness of his first tries. Switches flicked as Autumn rattled off shut-down procedures. The turbines spun down and the canopy popped. He put the ladder out and slid down. She followed, a little stiff in her new armour festooned with weapons and magazines that seemed to catch on everything.

"How do you move in this stuff?"

"You get used to it."

They hit the ground but did not run. 

"Has it changed much since last you were here?" Forest threw his battered leather hat in the air and a swarm of bees erupted out of it, spreading as they rose.

"Not that I can see from here."

As the bees built out their tactical map, Autumn simplified it, eliminating irrelevant details and highlighting potential threat locations; thin walls and grates mostly, hedges and other places suited to ambush concealment. The bees found a likely shelter, with crowds of dog-weeds, stego-bears and even two of those centipede digger transport things. 

"Sophia, eyes up. We can bolt back to the Galya, or ask Autumn for an M247H."

"A what?"

"Machine gun. Eyes up!" he pointed as they blotted out the sun.

She did the hair flick thing and her face vanished behind armour.

He chuffed with amusement. "Autumn, an M247H each please, overlapping arcs against that wall under the eave." 

Rather than boxes, they appeared draped under silky grey cloth like sculpture awaiting revelation. Autumn does have a theatrical streak.

Leaning into the moment, Forest took her hand and led her to them, whisking back a cloth to reveal a spanking new M247H already loaded with belt-feed ammunition from the ammunition box beside it. New brass gleamed its oily promise of mayhem. She placed her hands on the handles as he showed her the safety.

"You're hot!" he said, flicking it off.

"So I'm told."

He rolled his eyes, smiling, and readied his own. Clouds of murder-pigeons hove into focus and they both let fly.

"Short, controlled bursts. You don't want a cook-off."

His visor's active noise-cancelling brought the earsplitting racket down to a dull roar. "Autumn, hearing protection for Sophia?"

> _What do you take me for? It's in the helmet._

"She got a HUD?"

> _Yes?_

"Make sure she has a barrel heat indicator like mine. I don't want to stop shooting to unjam her."

They were faster than he remembered. The hail of fire they through up tore through the oncoming clouds, each round tumbling its gory way through half a dozen of the massed monsters. Mostly this threw them away, but one flew forward, striking his visor and smearing it _red_.

"Interesting. And they smell different too. Now I know why they're faster. These ones are using h&aelig;moglobin."

"Doesn't everything?"

"Antithesis mostly bleed green. I don't know why. It makes no sense to have chlorophyll in blood, it has to be cuproglobin, which is way less efficient."

"Oh," said Sophia, certain her boffins would have tried to tell her this at some point. She wondered what else they might have said that she ought to know in the field.

> _They could also be using myoglobin, which is the same colour as h&aelig;moglobin for all the same phys-chem reasons. But it's not likely; Myoglobin bonds so strongly to oxygen that it works better as a store of oxygen than a transport._

She stalked through the streets with unerring precision, Forest a half step behind. Charging hordes of single digit antithesis, swept aside like chaff before a storm as they took turns rolling swizzle sticks and bongos before them. A centiloader stared dumbly at them, dog-weeds stuffing mangled chickens and half a rottweiler into it.

In lock-step they armed and rolled grenades forward, dropping low to the ground as the fraggers tore off three of its legs. One of the three-eyed mongrels around it flung high and landed beside Sophia with a wet smack. Feebly, it snapped at her but they were on their feet and moving.

At Cantwell street the found the shelter. It was sealed, a good sign. She asked, and Autumn linked them in; surprisingly the commercial networks were still up.
