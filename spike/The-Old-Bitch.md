Eric looked at Sophia's departing back and watched her jump. She snagged the fourth rung and vaulted into the pilot seat of the Galya, running checks and startup sequence with the distracted competence of endless practice and a mind on the next mission. Two blokes from fireteam charlie were with her. Their old kit was long gone, replaced as it broke, first by Forest, later by Sophia, after what Eric liked to call the reckoning. They stowed duffle bags heavy with alien weaponry behind their seats, strapping them down. One of them took the gunner's seat, because you never knew.

Checks complete, the whine from the turbines rose and their pet monster heaved itself into the air. She was just a smidgen low, and when she brought the gunship about in what would have been a smooth motion, a wheel clipped the ground, rocking them.

"Just like him," muttered Eric.

Thoughts cascaded, as they do, and he fell into an old, happy memory. Sitting around a dinner table, a very glass half-full night up at Forest and Trixie's place. A dinner party, the one where Forest told a story about the dog that taught him to live.

For a memory the man clearly cherished it was pretty grim. The dog died, and Forest thought it was his fault. But Forest being Forest, instead of beating himself up over it he took the lesson as an expensive and precious gift, and carried the memory like some kind of sacred censer.

A fragment from the end of the dog tale came back, heard again in Forest's voice, that strange manner of speech he had for things he'd thought on endlessly, reduced to catechism: "...she who never barked at postmen, who did not mark boundaries with urine, who was his constant companion and the mother of his pups, she took on all those duties and did not falter in them until her hips gave out and she could not walk."

"Forest in mythic mode. Sylvan Myth." he chuckled, finally putting a name to that odd manner of speech. 

Then he paused, a thought forming. His hand went to his mouth, covering a half smile. She was just like... what was the dog's name? Misty. Keeping the faith, honouring what he thought was important. "Legacy, I guess. That's not what people _normally_ mean when they say 'loyal beyond death' but I'll take it."

Shaking his head with wry amusement, he walked over to where the Galya wasn't and rolled up the cast off tie-downs.
