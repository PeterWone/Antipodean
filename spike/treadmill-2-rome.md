Civilisation.

Hunter-gatherers, in clans, extended family, tribal and nomadic.

The invention of agriculture; man bending the world to his will, rather than adapting. 

Settled in place, few things threaten. What _can?_ We strive in concert, till our collective strength is geological in scale. With works of dam and road, on ever greater scale we master the wild and force it to submit.

And yet, without fail, we rise up! Only to fall again. And the night is long, as only those who dwell in it could truly tell.

_Why?_

We know why civilisation rises; it's obvious. A few good seasons, men band together and their strength multiplies. The only real threat is other men. But why is it inevitable that they fall again, they who are so mighty? 

This week our focus shifts from Ancient Egypt to another titan among civilisations: Rome

*## pisode 2: Rome - From Citizens to Subjects

*FADE IN: Dawn breaking over seven hills. Camera reveals the modest settlement of early Rome, wooden huts and small farms spread across the landscape.*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):** Rome began with a simple proposition: that free men, fighting for their own hearths and fields, were worth ten slaves or mercenaries in battle.

*SCENE: Roman farmstead, 450 BCE. MARCUS CINCINATUS works his small plot with his son LUCIUS. A messenger arrives on horseback.*

**MESSENGER:** Marcus Cincinatus! The Senate commands your presence. The Aequi threaten Rome itself.

**MARCUS:** *(setting down his plow)* Then Rome must be defended. Lucius, ready my armor.

**LUCIUS:** But father, the harvest—

**MARCUS:** Will wait. Some things matter more than grain.

*Cut to: Roman military camp. Citizens of all ages and social classes don armor, form ranks.*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):** For five hundred years, this principle carried Roman eagles from the Atlantic to the Euphrates. Citizens served in the legions, citizens voted in the forum, citizens bore the burden and shared the glory of an empire that came to encompass the civilised world.

*SCENE: Roman legion on the march. CENTURION GAIUS MAXIMUS addresses his century—all citizen-soldiers.*

**GAIUS MAXIMUS:** You fight not for pay, but for Rome. Not for a king, but for your fellow citizens. The man beside you tends his vineyard when we're not campaigning. The man behind you teaches his son to read. What we protect, we know. What we know, we fight for.

**YOUNG SOLDIER:** Centurion, the enemy outnumbers us three to one.

**GAIUS MAXIMUS:** Then each Roman must be worth three of them. Are you a citizen or a slave?

**YOUNG SOLDIER:** A citizen, sir!

**GAIUS MAXIMUS:** Then act like one.

*Battle scene: Romans fight with disciplined ferocity. Their shields form an unbreakable wall.*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):** The early Republic was built on citizen-soldiers who returned to their plows when the campaign season ended. They knew the stakes—these were their fields being defended, their families being protected, their future being secured.

*SCENE: Roman forum, 350 BCE. Citizens of all classes debate policy. SENATOR APPIUS CLAUDIUS addresses the crowd.*

**APPIUS CLAUDIUS:** Citizens of Rome! The Gauls offer us tribute to spare their cities. What say you?

**FARMER-VETERAN:** We fought to defend Rome, not to rob others. Let them keep their gold if they keep their peace.

**MERCHANT:** But think of the trade opportunities! Peaceful Gaul means profitable Gaul.

**YOUNG NOBLE:** Why not make them allies instead? Romans need not always conquer. Sometimes we can convince.

*The debate continues. Citizens argue passionately but respectfully.*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):** The Roman legion was not merely a military formation; it was a community in arms, bound by oaths of loyalty not just to commanders but to each other. When such men fought, they fought with the desperate courage of those who had everything to lose.

*SCENE: After battle, Romans tending their wounded. MARCUS (now older) helps a Germanic prisoner.*

**MARCUS:** Why do you help your enemy?

**GERMANIC WARRIOR:** You fought bravely. Courage deserves respect.

**MARCUS:** In Rome, brave enemies can become Roman citizens.

**GERMANIC WARRIOR:** *(surprised)* Citizens? Not slaves?

**MARCUS:** Citizens. My grandfather was Sabine. My wife's father was Etruscan. Now we are all Roman.

*Montage: Expansion of Roman territory, but also expansion of Roman citizenship. Defeated enemies become allies, allies become citizens.*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):** Their expansion was not mere conquest but incorporation. Defeated enemies became allies, allies became citizens. The genius of Rome lay not in ruling subject peoples but in making them Roman.

*SCENE: Roman villa, 200 BCE. LUCIUS CINCINATUS (now middle-aged) dines with guests from across the Mediterranean—Greeks, Gauls, Spaniards, all now Roman citizens.*

**GREEK SCHOLAR:** In Athens, we invented philosophy. In Rome, you've perfected it.

**GALLIC OFFICER:** I command Romans who were once my enemies. Now they would die for me, as I would for them.

**SPANISH MERCHANT:** Roman roads carry my goods from Cadiz to Antioch. Roman law protects my contracts in every province.

**LUCIUS:** *(raising his cup)* To Rome—not a place, but an idea. The idea that free men can govern themselves.

*All toast. Camera lingers on their faces—different peoples, united purpose.*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):** Greek learning, Gallic courage, Germanic discipline—all were absorbed into a civilisation that grew stronger with every addition. Rome's roads carried not just legions but ideas, trade, and the promise that even a shepherd in Gaul might one day see his son rise to the consulship.

*SCENE: Same Roman forum, now 100 BCE. The crowd is different—more urban, less martial. TRIBUNE GAIUS GRACCHUS addresses them.*

**GAIUS GRACCHUS:** Citizens! The small farmers who built Rome are driven from their land by slaves and foreign grain. What use is empire if Romans become beggars?

**WEALTHY SENATOR:** The grain dole feeds the people. Is this not generous?

**GAIUS GRACCHUS:** Generous? To make citizens dependent on gifts? Our fathers fought for their bread. Now their sons beg for it.

**CROWD:** *(chanting)* Bread and circuses! Bread and circuses!

**GAIUS GRACCHUS:** *(defeated)* What have we become?

*Cut to: Gladiatorial arena. Massive crowd cheers as gladiators fight. Camera focuses on the spectators—soft, complacent, entertained.*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):** But success bred transformation, and transformation bred weakness. The small farms that had produced citizen-soldiers gave way to vast slave-worked estates. The farmers themselves, impoverished by endless military service, drifted to Rome to live on grain doles and gladiatorial spectacles.

*SCENE: Military camp, 50 BCE. GENERAL JULIUS CAESAR addresses his troops—now mostly Germanic and Gallic mercenaries.*

**CAESAR:** Men of the Tenth Legion! We march on Rome itself!

**GERMANIC CAPTAIN:** We fight for Caesar, not for Rome.

**CAESAR:** *(pause)* Then for Caesar it shall be.

*No discussion of Roman law or citizen duty. Just orders and obedience.*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):** The legions, once filled with citizens fighting for their homeland, came to depend on barbarian mercenaries fighting for pay. The virtues that built Rome—discipline, service, sacrifice for the common good—withered in the luxury that Roman conquest had made possible.

*SCENE: Senate house, 44 BCE. BRUTUS and other senators discuss the assassination of Caesar.*

**BRUTUS:** We killed Caesar to save the Republic.

**CASSIUS:** But look around you. Where are the citizen-soldiers? Where are the farmer-senators? The Republic died long before Caesar.

**BRUTUS:** Then what have we done?

**CASSIUS:** Killed a tyrant to make room for another tyrant.

*Cut to: OCTAVIAN (future Augustus) addressing troops. The transition from Republic to Empire is complete.*

**OCTAVIAN:** I am your Emperor, and you are my subjects. The charade of the Republic is ended.

**PRAETORIAN CAPTAIN:** What of the Senate?

**OCTAVIAN:** They may keep their ceremonies. I will keep the power.

**NARRATOR (V.O.):** The Republic gave way to Empire, and Empire gave way to bureaucracy. Caesars replaced consuls, subjects replaced citizens. The forums where free men had once debated the fate of nations became stages for imperial ceremony.

*SCENE: Imperial court, 250 CE. EMPEROR DIOCLETIAN issues edicts to bureaucrats who have never seen a battlefield.*

**DIOCLETIAN:** The provinces must provide more soldiers, more taxes, more grain.

**BUREAUCRAT:** Majesty, the provincial governors report unrest. The people say the taxes are too heavy.

**DIOCLETIAN:** Then increase the punishments. Fear is more efficient than consent.

**BUREAUCRAT:** But sire, these are Roman citizens—

**DIOCLETIAN:** *(angry)* There are no citizens! There are subjects, and there are enemies. Treat them accordingly.

*Cut to: Provincial villa, same period. A ROMAN FAMILY barricades their doors as barbarian raiders approach.*

**ROMAN FATHER:** Where are the legions? Where is Rome's protection?

**ROMAN MOTHER:** The legions fight each other for the purple. There is no Rome anymore.

**NARRATOR (V.O.):** The very wealth that flowed from conquered provinces poisoned the wellspring of Roman strength. Why serve when you could be served? Why sacrifice when others would sacrifice for you? Why fight when mercenaries would fight in your place?

*SCENE: Walls of Rome, 410 CE. ALARIC and his Visigoth army stand before the gates. A ROMAN OFFICIAL negotiates.*

**ROMAN OFFICIAL:** Rome offers you gold, land, titles. What more could you want?

**ALARIC:** I want nothing from Rome. Rome has nothing to give.

**ROMAN OFFICIAL:** We are eternal! We are—

**ALARIC:** You are afraid. Your ancestors conquered the world with courage. You try to buy it with gold.

*The gates open. Romans open their own city to the barbarians.*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):** By the time Alaric's Visigoths appeared at Rome's gates, they found a city that had already forgotten how to defend itself.

*SCENE: Inside fallen Rome. HISTORIAN PROCOPIUS walks through abandoned buildings, dictating to his scribe.*

**PROCOPIUS:** What we witness is not conquest but inheritance. Rome did not fall to barbarian strength but to its own weakness—the weakness that comes when a civilisation becomes more concerned with consuming wealth than with creating the virtues that made wealth possible.

*Camera pulls back to reveal the empty forum, the broken statues, the silent temples.*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):** The eternal city fell not to barbarian strength but to its own weakness—the weakness that comes when a civilisation becomes more concerned with consuming wealth than with creating the virtues that made wealth possible in the first place.

*Final shot: Modern Rome, bustling with tourists photographing ancient ruins.*

**MODERN TOUR GUIDE:** *(to tourists)* The Colosseum could hold fifty thousand spectators. They came here to be entertained while their empire crumbled around them.

**TOURIST:** Why didn't they fight back?

**TOUR GUIDE:** *(pause)* Perhaps they had forgotten how.

*Fade to black. Title card: "Next week: The Ming - Turning from the Sea"*
