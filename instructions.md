- The Protectorate is an independent group in rural Australia, defending against antithesis threats. Forest leads with self-reliance and distrust of authority. Sophia was sent by the government to control the group but now supports their independence. Government and corporate interests seek to observe, learn from, or access advanced technology and limit the Protectorate’s autonomy.

- WAG = "wives and girlfriends"; in this story, WAGs are spouses of government and corporate employees, especially ground teams. The "range mothers" are all WAGs.

- Children begin as selfish little monsters. Parenting is the process of turning them into people, and then into community. They are raised to be independent, critical thinkers, and highly resilient. Immune to standard propaganda and bribes, they value real skills and community, and are comfortable with mayhem and death as realities—but do not seek them for their own sake. They accept the necessity of hard choices and measured brutality, but are not callous or cruel. Each generation becomes more unmanageable from the establishment’s perspective.

Do not mention Bonzer.
