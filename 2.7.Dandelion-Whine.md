Sophia left a message asking Vanderbilt to have security monitor outbound correspondence for everyone who knew about the spatial lockers. 

"We are not," she wrote, "trying to assign blame after a leak. We are going to _prevent_ a leak. Remind your people that apart from the trouble it would cause, a leak will increase the competition for those Nobel prizes. And point out that I've even put you and me on the watch list. It's a safety net in case we slip in policing ourselves." 

Vanderbilt replied promptly, adding that he would include a test phrase and deliberately trigger a report next week.

As it turned out, thermobarics were adequate and they didn't have to deploy a spatial lock. 

Later that afternoon, Forest Grump put down the Galya in Oleksiy's front paddock, an open field by the valley road. He explained to Sissi that Oleksiy was fine and on his way in the Triton. 

Sophia sent Eric down to debrief Forest. When Oleksiy arrived, Eric and Forest were in his lounge enjoying Sissi's hospitality and drinking tea. Autumn pulled relevant footage from drones and the Galya, putting it on Eric's notebook. She and Forest filled him in on the seeds and how they used fire to throw them far and wide.

Concise as ever, Oleksiy nodded and said "Too small to shoot. Don't burn."

Forest mused "The seed pod thing wasn't especially violent. There were only a handful of dog-weeds."

"Big birds. Small birds, many." Oleksiy's smile had the devil in it: "Also hydra."

"Yes, thank you Autumn for sharing that with everyone."

> _I live to serve._

"So anyway, it's a total clusterfuck. Only the weather bureau could tell you where the seeds went. My guess is "all over New South Wales" but that's not a useful answer. I know a Canadian woman who specialises in dust monitoring. Mostly it's used for working out whether the dust came from a mine or the farms around it."

"Why would that matter?"

"Mines have money. Governments like taking it from them. Fines and whatnot."

"And this dust woman, she works for the mines or the government?"

"She sells weapons to both sides."

"You said she was Canadian."

"Yes?"

"That's a very American thing to do."

"She apologises for everything and says "eh" a lot."

"Alright, she's Canadian."

"We have to assume that whatever grows will be hostile. Look, Eric, we fucked up. Nobody including alien super-AIs saw it coming but that does not help us clean it up. Sophia's going to have to get all the help we can get from the Bureau of Meteorology, and they have to give answers we can use. I'll talk to Autumn about what support we might be able to give in terms of tracking tech. Maybe there are other Vanguard with tools more suited to tracking feathers from orbit. But even if we find them we still don't know what to _do_ with them &mdash; suck 'em up in a vacuum cleaner? We don't know what conditions they need to germinate, or how fast they'll grow."

Janna turned up, all smiles. There were, we learnt, new piglets.

"Boar making bacon" observed Oleksiy, but he pronounced the G so no one got the joke.

"Have you seen the news?" she asked, "It's snowing in the hills near Tenterfield!" She pulled out her tablet and showed us a streamer as vapid as she was pretty. The girl blithered about how pretty it was as thousands of white tufts floated in the air under a leaden skies. And then the heavens opened and countless bedraggled seed pods settled out of the sky."

> _I told you he was lucky. For anyone else this would be an unmitigated fiasco, but chuckles here has lucked out as usual. Look at this!_

Autumn took over Oleksiy's TV and showed us a rather beautiful 3D rendering of weather systems and terrain.

> _First they got funnelled in here&mdash;_

Streamers showed the flow of air corralled between ranges of mountains, herded into a box canyon.

> _Then the end of the box canyon forced the air mass up, whereupon it rained. And they may be fireproof but they still get soggy._

"I have to go, she'll want me to run a cleanup crew." Eric was already moving and calling his office.

"They're gunna want us there in case it grows or something." 

Sissi wanted to feed us, but there wasn't time. We took the Galya into town and got pizza and drinks because they have a big empty carpark that fits the Galya. The last part was pure optimism but it worked, which only encouraged Autumn in her rant about me being a tinny bastard.

"Where are you now?" it was Eric.

"Airborne, two minutes out. Sitrep?"

"I'll let you guess."

"Righto. Want us to pick you up or will you stay with the ground vehicles?" Oleksiy stuffed pizza in his mouth and swallowed. He took a pull of Coke and burped hugely. "We have pizza. No beer, unfortunately, but that's pilots for you."

"What kind of pizza?"

"All kinds of pizza. And the storage behind the turbines is hot so it won't be cold." 

"Airborne it is. Sophia says she wants ham and pineapple."

"She's coming?"

"She says you're a bad influence. I think she wants a date."

"I heard that!"
