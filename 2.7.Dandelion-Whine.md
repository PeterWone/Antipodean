Sophia left a message asking Vanderbilt to have security monitor outbound correspondence for everyone who knew about the spatial lockers. 

"We are not," she wrote, "trying to assign blame after a leak. We are going to _prevent_ a leak. Remind your people that apart from the trouble it would cause, a leak will increase the competition for those Nobel prizes. And point out that I've even put you and me on the watch list. It's a safety net in case we slip in policing ourselves." 

Vanderbilt replied promptly, adding that he would include a test phrase and deliberately trigger a report next week.

As it turned out, thermobarics were adequate and they didn't have to deploy a spatial lock.

Later that afternoon, Forest Grump put down the Galya in Oleksiy's front paddock, an open field by the valley road. He explained to Sissi that Oleksiy was fine and on his way in the Triton.

Sophia sent Eric down to debrief Forest. When Oleksiy arrived, Eric and Forest were in his lounge enjoying Sissi's hospitality and drinking tea. Autumn pulled relevant footage from drones and the Galya, putting it on Eric's notebook. She and Forest filled him in on the seeds and how they used fire to throw them far and wide.

Concise as ever, Oleksiy nodded and said "Too small to shoot. Don't burn."

Forest mused "The seed pod thing wasn't especially violent. There were only a handful of dog-weeds."

"Big birds. Small birds, many." Oleksiy's smile had the devil in it: "Also hydra."

"Yes, thank you Autumn for sharing that with everyone."

> _I live to serve._

"So anyway, it's a total clusterfuck. Only the weather bureau could tell you where the seeds went. My guess is "all over New South Wales" but that's not a useful answer. I know a Canadian woman who specialises in dust monitoring. Mostly it's used for working out whether the dust came from a mine or the farms around it."

"Why would that matter?"

"Mines have money. Governments like taking it from them. Fines and whatnot."

"And this dust woman, she works for the mines or the government?"

"She sells weapons to both sides."

"You said she was Canadian."

"Yes?"

"That's a very American thing to do."

"She apologises for everything and says "eh" a lot."

"Alright, she's Canadian. What does she have to do with this?"

"She's good at working out where things get blown to. It's a long shot."

Sighing with frustration at our directionless rambling I tried to get us on track.

"We have to assume that whatever grows will be hostile. Look, Eric, we fucked up. Nobody including alien super-AIs saw it coming but that does not help us clean it up. Sophia's going to have to get all the help we can from the Bureau of Meteorology, and they have to give answers we can use. I'll talk to Autumn about what support we might be able to give in terms of tracking tech. Maybe there are other Vanguard with tools more suited to tracking feathers from orbit. But even if we find them we still don't know what to _do_ with them &mdash; suck 'em up in a vacuum cleaner? We don't know what conditions they need to germinate, or how fast they'll grow."

Neither of us knew what to do. We sat there, stewing.

Then Janna turned up, all smiles. There were, we learnt, new piglets.

"Boar making bacon" observed Oleksiy, but he pronounced the G so no one got the joke.

"Have you seen the news?" asked Janna. "It's snowing in the hills near Tenterfield!" She pulled out her tablet and showed us a streamer as vapid as she was pretty. The girl blithered about miracles of nature as thousands of white tufts floated in the air under a leaden skies. 

Then, on the tiny screen, the heavens opened and torrential rain washed countless white seed pods out of the sky, bedraggled chicken feathers stuck now in mud. Our own little miracle.

> _I told you he was lucky. For anyone else this would be an unmitigated fiasco, but chuckles here has lucked out as usual. Look at this!_

Autumn took over Oleksiy's TV and showed us a rather beautiful 3D rendering of weather systems and terrain.

> _First they got funnelled in here&mdash;_

Streamers showed the flow of air corralled between ranges of mountains, herded into a box canyon.

> _Then the end of the box canyon forced the air mass up, whereupon it rained. And they may be fireproof but they still get soggy._

Janna's not as dumb as people think: "Ten thousand antithesis seeds got watered into the ground? _That_ doesn't sound good."

Eric and I looked at each other.

"I have to go, she'll want me to run a cleanup crew." He was already on the move, calling his office.

---

"They're gunna want us there in case it grows or something." 

Sissi wanted to feed us, but there wasn't time. We took the Galya into town for pizza and drinks because they have a big empty carpark that fits the Galya. The last part was pure optimism but it worked, which only encouraged Autumn in her rant about me being a <span style="border: thin dotted" title="Australian idiom meaning someone who is extremely lucky, often undeservedly so.">tinny bastard</span>.

My phone rang. I picked up. 

"Where are you now?" it was Eric.

"Airborne, two minutes out. Sitrep?"

"I'll let you guess."

"Righto. Want us to pick you up or will you stay with the ground vehicles?" Beside me Oleksiy stuffed pizza in his mouth and swallowed. He took a pull of Coke and burped hugely. I continued. "We have pizza. No beer, unfortunately, but that's pilots for you."

"What kind of pizza?"

"All kinds of pizza. And the storage behind the turbines is a hotbox, so it won't get cold." 

He had to be on the valley road, so it it wasn't long before Oleksiy spotted Eric in his car and buzzed him, turning and hovering over a farm paddock by the road. Eric got the hint and pulled over. We set down as he jogged up. As we settled I popped the canopy and put the ladder out. Oleksiy didn't stop the engine and Eric didn't muck about. We were airborne again in twenty seconds.

"Airborne it is. Sophia says she wants ham and pineapple."

"She's coming?"

"She says you're a bad influence. I think she wants a date."

"I _heard_ that!" said Eric's phone, loud and clear on hands-free.

"Nah, she likes Trixie. More likely she wants to go weapons-hot in a legendary Russian helicopter gunship kitted out with alien space magic."

"That is absolutely not the case," said the phone, "Today. Security tells me you put down in the meadow outside the Russian's house, is that&mdash;"

Stereo: _"Not Russian!"_

"&mdash;a good place to wait?"

> _Yes, Sophia. That's an excellent choice. I'll fly us over there, otherwise these characters will leave you standing in a field while they eat pizza. Flight time is approximately two minutes, we're already in the valley. See you shortly. Gentlemen, fasten your seatbelts and secure all junk food, we're off._

We banked, still rising, and turned for home. Clear of obstacles and properly warmed up, Autumn pushed us to sixty percent power. She tilted us forward like a runner on a starting block, stabilised and punched it up to eighty. 

"Boo-yah!" Eric's glee settled, his fist lowered and he looked at me, no, at my visor. He put on one of the headsets. "So, Autumn... are there any more like you at home?" The glass cockpit turned into a toned-down schoolgirl Cortana, peering cheekily out at him.

> _There are! But I warn you, we're a handful._

"I'm afraid she's spoken for."

> _Izzat so, buster?_

"Yep. Now and forever. Or at least until you feed me to the next hive."

> _I'm sorry, Dave. I can't do that._

"What _can_ you do? I was told you were the best."

> _This!_

The helicopter barrel-rolled, so perfectly we didn't spill any pizza. Given our speed it was masterful piloting.

"Wow, that was awesome!"

> _Thank you._

"Gives a whole new meaning to Flying Toasters!"

> _You'll keep._

She throttled back, feathering slightly and setting down about twenty metres from where Sophia stood at the edge of the road, leaning on the fence and talking to, of all people, Janna. "Well, well," I chortled. "Isn't _that_ just fascinating." Also notable was the interest her pigs were showing around the oaks flanking Oleksiy's driveway. The oaks were only about thirty years old, not enough, I would have said. But you can't fool pigs. A perimeter drone buzzed them until they moved off. I saw the invisible hand of Autumn in that. It wasn't surprising, she likes Oleksiy. 

"How did you know?" I asked.

> _I seeded them. Or spored them. With one of the borer drones we use for the hives. It was Janna's idea, he's seventy next year._

"I won't ask where the hell you got truffle spores."

> _Nor should you, the answer is obvious: from a truffle._

Autumn popped the double-bubble. I lowered and hooked the ladder, brandishing a big slice of pizza and bellowing "Get it while it's hot!"

Decked out in what can only be described as designer bushwalking gear, Sophia wore a cute little ozcam sunhat, a forest green coverall, and glossy black gumboots. With heels. Sensible heels, but nevertheless... I wondered how tall she was. Four inch heels in the office brought her eyes level with my nose, so probably 160cm, thereabouts. "Five foot two, eyes are blue...Has anybody seen my girl?" rattled up from the distant past. "She's not so bad now the Karen is rubbing off," I mused. "Probably just needs a good spanking to loosen her up." 

> _I wonder what Trixie would think about that._

"She'd say 'Promises promises, whatever' and do that chin-thrust thing she thinks looks like me."

Autumn sighed. Sophia said her farewells to Janna, who rounded up her pigs to go home. Strolling over, she ascended the ladder, gracefully swinging one leg after the other into the cockpit and sinking into&mdash;

"That was _my_ seat."

"It was very gentlemanly of you to give it up." She held out an expectant hand: "I heard rumours of hot pizza." 

Eric produced a completely unmolested pizza box from the turbine adjacent stowage and opened it, leaning forward to offer it to her. "Ham and pineapple." She surprised me by taking the whole box and putting it in her lap. "Thin crust!" It disappeared into her mouth but reappeared amid most unladylike gagging. _"Waaaugh! Hot!"_ She had a second go and this time it disappeared. "Eric, why haven't I seconded you?"

"Perhaps because this was my first opportunity to deliver pizza with an assault helicopter. It uses a lot of fuel, but what's forty litres of kerosene against a hot pizza?"

"Alright everyone, Elvis is in the building. Let's get this show on the road."

Engines thundered through the cabin as they raced toward the hills east of Tenterfield. Autumn maintained her crisp efficiency, drones trailing behind, swift but unable to match the Galyaâ€™s might. Oleksiy lapped the canyon, leaning forward, scanning the terrain below. 

Sophia stayed out of the way while capable people worked.

> _Itâ€™s here._ 

> _The seeds are all over this valley, mostly where it boxes, just like our streamer friend showed us. But I've also picked up... activity. A lot of it. They're no longer dormant._

Sophia frowned, her eyes narrowing. "Activity?"

> _Biomass harvesting. It looks like the seeds soften in water and release a tiny harvester. Little minions are hard at work consuming everything organic they can get their tendrils on. Itâ€™s mayhem down there._

Forest leaned back and took a deep breath,  expression grim. "The streamer, is she still broadcasting?"

Autumn hesitated.

> _No. Her feed cut out not long ago, but the last few seconds showed... well, she didn't enjoy her last moments._

Sophiaâ€™s grip tightened on her tablet, jaw set. "So the whole valley is hostile. Autumn, I'm sending people in there. I need a risk assessment, if you wouldn't mind. Mr Kovalenko, prepare for a low level visual survey. We need eyes on this before we make any moves."

Oleksiy shook his head. "Stay high," he said. "Too much risk. Look first, decide later."

> _I must agree with Oleksiy. The Galya is safer up here. I have plenty of drones and more are arriving. I can handle survey. I'll get you high-res visuals, thermal scans, and movement patterns. While we wait, eat the rest of the pizza and order your thoughts._

Sophia exhaled sharply. "No more surprises. I would really appreciate it if you can keep us ahead of whatever's happening down there."

> _Don't worry, Sophia. I'll keep you in the loop. While you wait, you might want to talk to your office. There's no hiding this one. She broadcast her own death. All of it._

They ate and drank, but the festive cheer was gone. Sophia spoke to her staff. They weren't too concerned because gruesome as it was, it played well for convincing people they wanted to stay put in their fifteen minute cities.

As they washed off altitude, the mood in the cabin darkened. The ground _writhed_ like a week-old carcass.

"Autumn, the stuff in the flesh-melter grenades: can I buy it in a big drum with some sort of crop-dusting rig?" 

> _Yes, but it's fairly heavy and we don't have any spare hard-points._

Oleksiy tilted us forward, flicked a cap off a switch, armed and fired in one smooth movement. "Forward mount is empty." I'd like to say that fireworks bloomed on the ground ahead, but these were real weapons. There was a puff of dust, an actinic flash inside the dust, and the dustcloud got bigger a fraction of a second  before the Galya was slapped by a giant.

We settled smoothly in Oleksiy's capable hands, and Autumn did her thing. An ugly drum of elliptical section appeared on the hard-point with a hanging boom. Oleksiy tried the controls for the hard-point and found the trigger release a spray. He brought us down to thirty metres and began drenching the little monsters.

"That is going to make a hell of a mess." Flesh melters work on people and trees too.

> _The antithesis won't leave **anything** if we don't do it._

Oleksiy said nothing and kept spraying.

> _Take us up ten metres please, Oleksiy. The spray isn't good for our engines._

Sophia was in shock from Oleksiy' unhesitant, unflinching discard of a weapon in the same price range as a house. I didn't know what aspect rattled her the most, the "Russian" being in the hot-seat, throwing away a missile or her first point-blank boom. I _did_ know how to bring her back to herself. From long talks with Autumn I knew "Karen" was a consequence of grinding through the glass ceiling in a male-dominated space. Internally? Logistics and leadership incarnate.

"What are your people bringing? We won't get everything here, there'll be things under rocks and probably quite a few outside this valley. Do your people need anything? It's probably a good idea to put me on the ground with them."

She stared at me. Her mouth closed and her eyes focussed, fingers drifting to her augs. Whatever she said it was to Eric, because he stopped staring and started making his own calls. Oleksiy told us what he thought by killing the spray and retreating to just outside the mouth of the box canyon. We set down, and I slid down the ladder, pizza in hand, nun-blaster slung low.

"Autumn? Can I have a drink please? For hydration more than pleasure." Even in the mountains it can be hot at this time of day. The recent downpour made it briefly humid. Fortunately it wasn't long before the ground vehicles finally caught up and we set to sweeping.
