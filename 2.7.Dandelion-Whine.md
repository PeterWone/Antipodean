Sophia left a message asking Vanderbilt to have security monitor outbound correspondence for everyone who knew about the spatial lockers. 

"We are not," she wrote, "trying to assign blame after a leak. We are going to _prevent_ a leak. Remind your people that apart from the trouble it would cause, a leak will increase the competition for those Nobel prizes. And point out that I've even put you and me on the watch list. It's a safety net in case we slip in policing ourselves." 

Vanderbilt replied promptly, adding that he would include a test phrase and deliberately trigger a report next week.

As it turned out, thermobarics were adequate and they didn't have to deploy a spatial lock. 

Later that afternoon, Forest Grump put down the Galya in Oleksiy's front paddock, an open field by the valley road. He explained to Sissi that Oleksiy was fine and on his way in the Triton. 

Sophia sent Eric down to debrief Forest. When Oleksiy arrived, Eric and Forest were in his lounge enjoying Sissi's hospitality and drinking tea. Autumn pulled relevant footage from drones and the Galya, putting it on Eric's notebook. She and Forest filled him in on the seeds and how they used fire to throw them far and wide.

Concise as ever, Oleksiy nodded and said "Too small to shoot. Don't burn."

Forest mused "The seed pod thing wasn't especially violent. There were only a handful of dog-weeds."

"Big birds. Small birds, many." Oleksiy's smile had the devil in it: "Also hydra."

"Yes, thank you Autumn for sharing that with everyone."
