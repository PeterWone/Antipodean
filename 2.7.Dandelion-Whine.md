Sophia left a message asking Vanderbilt to have security monitor outbound correspondence for everyone who knew about the spatial lockers. 

"We are not," she wrote, "trying to assign blame after a leak. We are going to _prevent_ a leak. Remind your people that apart from the trouble it would cause, a leak will increase the competition for those Nobel prizes. And point out that I've even put you and me on the watch list. It's a safety net in case we slip in policing ourselves." 

Vanderbilt replied promptly, adding that he would include a test phrase and deliberately trigger a report next week.

As it turned out, thermobarics were adequate and they didn't have to deploy a spatial lock. 

Later that afternoon, Forest Grump put down the Galya in Oleksiy's front paddock, an open field by the valley road. He explained to Sissi that Oleksiy was fine and on his way in the Triton. 

Sophia sent Eric down to debrief Forest. When Oleksiy arrived, Eric and Forest were in his lounge enjoying Sissi's hospitality and drinking tea. Autumn pulled relevant footage from drones and the Galya, putting it on Eric's notebook. She and Forest filled him in on the seeds and how they used fire to throw them far and wide.

Concise as ever, Oleksiy nodded and said "Too small to shoot. Don't burn."

Forest mused "The seed pod thing wasn't especially violent. There were only a handful of dog-weeds."

"Big birds. Small birds, many." Oleksiy's smile had the devil in it: "Also hydra."

"Yes, thank you Autumn for sharing that with everyone."

> _I live to serve._

"So anyway, it's a total clusterfuck. Only the weather bureau could tell you where the seeds went. My guess is "all over New South Wales" but that's not a useful answer. I know a Canadian woman who specialises in dust monitoring. Mostly it's used for working out whether the dust came from a mine or the farms around it."

"Why would that matter?"

"Mines have money. Governments like taking it from them. Fines and whatnot."

"And this dust woman, she works for the mines or the government?"

"She sells weapons to both sides."

"You said she was Canadian."

"Yes?"

"That's a very American thing to do."

"She apologises for everything and says "eh" a lot."

"Alright, she's Canadian."

"We have to assume that whatever grows will be hostile. Look, Eric, we fucked up. Nobody including alien super-AIs saw it coming but that does not help us clean it up. Sophia's going to have to get all the help we can get from the Bureau of Meteorology, and they have to give answers we can use. I'll talk to Autumn about what support we might be able to give in terms of tracking tech. Maybe there are other Vanguard with tools more suited to tracking feathers from orbit. But even if we find them we still don't know what to _do_ with them &mdash; suck 'em up in a vacuum cleaner? We don't know what conditions they need to germinate, or how fast they'll grow."

Janna turned up, all smiles. There were, we learnt, new piglets.

"Boar making bacon" observed Oleksiy, but he pronounced the G so no one got the joke.

"Have you seen the news?" she asked, "It's snowing in the hills near Tenterfield!" She pulled out her tablet and showed us a streamer as vapid as she was pretty. The girl blithered about how pretty it was as thousands of white tufts floated in the air under a leaden skies. And then the heavens opened and countless bedraggled seed pods settled out of the sky."

> _I told you he was lucky. For anyone else this would be an unmitigated fiasco, but chuckles here has lucked out as usual. Look at this!_

Autumn took over Oleksiy's TV and showed us a rather beautiful 3D rendering of weather systems and terrain.

> _First they got funnelled in here&mdash;_

Streamers showed the flow of air corralled between ranges of mountains, herded into a box canyon.

> _Then the end of the box canyon forced the air mass up, whereupon it rained. And they may be fireproof but they still get soggy._

"I have to go, she'll want me to run a cleanup crew." Eric was already moving and calling his office.

"They're gunna want us there in case it grows or something." 

Sissi wanted to feed us, but there wasn't time. We took the Galya into town and got pizza and drinks because they have a big empty carpark that fits the Galya. The last part was pure optimism but it worked, which only encouraged Autumn in her rant about me being a tinny bastard.

"Where are you now?" it was Eric.

"Airborne, two minutes out. Sitrep?"

"I'll let you guess."

"Righto. Want us to pick you up or will you stay with the ground vehicles?" Oleksiy stuffed pizza in his mouth and swallowed. He took a pull of Coke and burped hugely. "We have pizza. No beer, unfortunately, but that's pilots for you."

"What kind of pizza?"

"All kinds of pizza. And the storage behind the turbines is hot so it won't be cold." 

"Airborne it is. Sophia says she wants ham and pineapple."

"She's coming?"

"She says you're a bad influence. I think she wants a date."

"I heard that!"

"Nah, she likes Trixie. More likely she wants to go weapons hot in a legendary Russian helicopter gunship kitted out with alien space magic."

"That is absolutely not the case. Today. Security tells me you put down in the meadow outside the Russian's house, is that&mdash;"

Stereo: _"Not Russian!"_

"&mdash;a good place to wait?"

> _Yes, Sophia. That's an excellent choice. I'll fly us over there, otherwise these characters will leave you standing in a field while they sit here eating pizza. Flight time is approximately six minutes. See you shortly. Gentlemen, fasten your seatbelts and secure all pizza boxes, we'll be taking off in ninety seconds._

A drone flew out the door and we heard Oleksiy's check sequence rattled off at high speed.

> _Oleksiy, would you mind doing the fuel contamination check please? The drone can't push hard enough._

The same startup sounds. Some things just cannot be rushed. The starter motor compressed air into tanks. Control surfaces clonked as Autumn sock-puppeted the autopilot, checking for free movement without play. A whine slowly rose. There was an almost-bang as the fires lit and the beast roared to life. Five blades spun faster and faster, feathered to no lift. Of a sudden they bit the air and yanked us straight up for six metres. We banked, still rising, and turned for home. Clear of obstacles and properly warmed up, Autumn pushed us to sixty percent power. She tilted us forward like a runner on a starting block, stabilised and punched it up to eighty. 

"Boo-yah!" Eric's glee settled, his fist lowered and he looked at me, no, my visor. He put on one of the headsets. "So, Autumn... are there any more like you at home?" The glass cockpit turned into a toned-down schoolgirl Cortana, peering cheekily out at him.

> _There are! But I warn you, we're a handful._

"I'm afraid she's spoken for."

> _Izzat so, buster?_

"Yep. Now and forever. Or at least until you feed me to the next hive."

> _I'm sorry, Dave. I can't do that._

"What _can_ you do? I was told you were the best."

> _This!_

The helicopter barrel-rolled, so perfectly we didn't spill any pizza. Given our speed it was masterful piloting.

"Wow, that was awesome!"

> _Thank you._

"Gives a whole new meaning to Flying Toasters!"

> _You'll keep._

She throttled back slowly, feathering slightly and setting down about twenty metres from where Sophia stood at the edge of the road, leaning on the fence and talking to, of all people, Janna. "Well, well," I chortled. "Isn't that interesting." Also interesting was the interest her pigs were showing around the oaks flanking Oleksiy's driveway. They were only about thirty years old, not enough, I would have said. But you can't fool pigs. A perimeter drone buzzed them until they moved off. I saw the invisible hand of Autumn in that. It wasn't surprising, she likes Oleksiy. 

"How did you know?" I asked.

> _I seeded them. Or spored them. With one of the borer drones we use for the hives. It was Janna's idea, he's seventy next year._

"I won't ask where the hell you got truffle spores."

> _Nor should you, the answer is thunderingly obvious: from a truffle._

Autumn popped the double-bubble. I lowered and hooked the ladder, brandishing a big slice of pizza and bellowing "Get it while it's hot!"

Kitted out in what can only be described as designer bushwalker style, Sophia wore a forest green coverall and glossy black gumboots. With heels. Sensible heels, but nevertheless... I wondered how tall she was. Four inch heels in the office brought her eyes level with my nose, so probably 160cm, thereabouts. "Five foot two, eyes are blue...Has anybody seen my girl?" rattled up from the distant past. "She's not so bad now the Karen is rubbing off," I mused. "Probably just needs a good spanking to loosen her up." 

> _I wonder what Trixie would think about that._

"She'd say 'Promises promises, whatever' and do that chin-thrust thing she thinks looks like me."

Autumn sighed. Sophia said her farewells to Janna, who rounded up her pigs to go home. She strolled over and climbed the ladder, gracefully swinging one leg after the other into the cockpit and sinking into&mdash;

"That was _my_ seat."

"It was very gentlemanly of you to give it up." She held out an expectant hand: "I heard rumours of hot pizza." 

Eric produced a completely unmolested pizza box from the turbine adjacent stowage and opened it, leaning forward to offer it to her. "Ham and pineapple." She surprised me by taking the whole box and putting it in her lap. "Thin crust!" It disappeared into her mouth but reappeared amid most unladylike gagging. "_Hot!_ She had a second go and this time it disappeared. "Eric, why haven't I seconded you?"

"Possibly because this was my first opportunity to deliver pizza with an assault helicopter. It uses a lot of fuel, but what's forty litres of fuel against a hot pizza?"

"Alright everyone, Elvis is in the building. Let's get this show on the road."
