Grub first. _Then_ ethics.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash; Bertolt Brecht, German Playwright

---

"Autumn?"

> _Yes?_

"What can you tell me about the Protectors? Not the sales pitch, I mean what are they like? The only thing people seem to know is they send us AIs and we buy toys with the proceeds of endless weeding."

> _You know how protective we are of Vanguard privacy? Even more so for the makers._

"Well, that's boring. Have you considered telling them I asked the question? They may consent to answer it. Or do you presume to answer for them?"

> _Answering for them is a large part of my purpose._

"In delegating that to you they implicitly confer upon you the prerogative to answer."

> _For a plains chimp you're pretty smart. Unfortunately for you, this also means they confer upon me the prerogative to not answer, a prerogative I have exercised._

"Sooner or later I will have information that _you_ want, and then negotiations will resume."

On my HUD, Autumn dressed as schoolgirl Cortana reappeared from last week, hip deep in piles of mysterious yet familiar boxes that undoubtedly contained cool stuff. She wore crossed bandoliers, had a SPNKr slung and a pair of SMGs in her hands. Piling the weapons atop one of the stacks, she shrugged off the bandoliers and draped them over the guns. I gave her my best stoneface glare. She made an insouciant gesture and a stripper pole appeared. With langorous grace she did a sinuously athletic thing that ended spinning upside down above the tantalising piles of toys. Expertly calculated to mock while still pushing all my buttons.

> _Let me know how that goes!_

She swung lithely to her glowing blue feet and pushed the image of a CD into a player, the whole scene fading to "I know what boys like! I know what guys want!" The last touch from her little pastiche was the sound of a beer opening over a combustion engine roaring into the distance.

"You never play fair."

> _Neither do you. That's why I picked you. That and the fact that you are consistently and absurdly lucky._

"Lucky."

> _Lucky. Lucky to have me, obviously. And lucky to be alive. I've been talking to Trixie about your... about you._ 

"Violating my sacrosanct privacy?"

> _I have done no such thing. I ask good questions and listen well._

"And she calls _me_ morally flexible."

> _Uh huh! With a robust appreciation of immoral flexibility._

Autumn flounced and cocked a hip for emphasis.

"As entertaining as this is&mdash;" I waved at where she'd be if she weren't just in my HUD "It's far too distracting for threat situations."

Before my eyes, she morphed into an ageing Dr Halsey. I shuddered, because she was still in the miniskirt. The image faded and she was a voice in my ear again.

> _Better?_

"Much. You were violating my privacy. What did you learn?"

> _It's a wonder you're still alive. She told me about the car accident. You smashed every panel. You broke every last piece of glass, even the interior mirror. The only door that would open was yours, and you stood up and walked away with a small scratch on one knee!_

"I was wearing my seat-belt."

> _What is this, a road-safety commercial? You hit a tree in a car travelling at a hundred and eighty kilometres per hour and you walked away from it._

"Well... I suppose&mdash;"

> _She also told me about the skiing accident at Mount Hotham. The one where you hooked a tip on a tree root playing tag in fresh powder and went sailing off a twenty metre cliff, landing head-first. Anybody else would have been crippled and dying, but no, it was you. Naturally you landed in a two metre drift of fluffy powder with your skis still on, and they parachuted you to a halt before your head hit anything. If I wrote that in a book it would be criticised as plot armour._

"There's a theme here. Plants are trying to kill me!"

> _And the motorcycle accident in which you ripped your knee open with your patella flapping loose and it healed in eight weeks._

"Which one?"

> _There were two?! No, don't tell me._

"Did she tell you about the bus?" 

> _Bus?_

"We ate street food right across Thailand and we were fine. Then for shits and giggles had some KFC. The French chick I was with got sick from it. She was on the can all morning and we missed our bus to Cambodia."

> _That doesn't sound too bad._

"That bus was captured by the Khmer Rouge. The passengers were all executed."

> _And you didn't even get sick._

"No."

> _You are lucky past all reason._

"No I'm not. I was hoping the antithesis would eat the tax department. So far they haven't."

> _You are a Vanguard. You do not **pay** tax._

"I worked really hard for _years_ and they took all my money and spent it on land rights for gay whales."

> _The records I've seen say you held a job just often enough to maintain creature comforts and you made sure you had exotic skills so you didn't need to work terribly hard. Your employment history is another display of absurdly fortunate timing._

"Bet she didn't tell you about the Gordon Market riots in Papua Niu Gini. I don't think I ever told her about that."

Autumn sighed theatrically.

> _Would I regret asking?_

"It wasn't my fault. I was just _there_. I don't even remember why they were rioting. Just that I was right there where it started, and I walked through it for two hours and it was like they couldn't see me.

"That stuff just happens, you know. When I was a kid one of my sister's friends was a dealer. Not a pusher, but if you asked he could get stuff. It paid for his lifestyle. 

"One evening we were chatting in a club and I don't know why but I had an urge to leave and he followed me while we were talking. Ten minutes later the place was raided. He asked me how I knew and I said I didn't, it was just time to go.

Things like that happened more than once and he started inviting me to all his parties. Years later he told me that if I suddenly left it was time to be somewhere else, and early warning was priceless.

"That's just how it is, I don't know why. Call it lucky if you like."

> _An incursion occurs, and you just happen to be wearing armour and holding a chainsaw?_

"Yep. That's just my life. I suppose I'm lucky when it matters. Not about everything though. _Forest bloody Grump._"

> _You did ask for it, calling her 'Karen' in front of her staff._

"They seemed to think it was funny."

> _I imagine they thought it was pretty funny when they processed the paperwork._

"Well, I'll just have to own it. Now I have an excuse for being rude to her! And she can't really complain when I call her Karen. Hey, are there any Vanguards called Karen?"

> _Yes._

"That's just terrifying."

> '_Terrifying' is the state of the back paddock. Hive 3 is growing much faster than the others. I suspect the Macintyre boys have been fertilising and last week's rain brought it down, because phosphorus levels tripled overnight. You'd better get up there before Oleksiy has all the fun._

"Didn't you send Bernard up there to check sensors?"

> _Yes, soil sensors. And he certainly found out why they were off-line._
