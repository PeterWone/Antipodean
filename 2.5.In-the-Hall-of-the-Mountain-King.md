The model showed a tunnel into the far side of the hill. It was clearly artificial, and either very old or privately built. The entry was framed with heavy timber baulks, ancient hardwood showing no sign of rot in the dry conditions.

I sure as hell wasn't going in there. Underground was the borer's world. Fighting something on its home turf is crazy. By the same token, giving the antithesis time to literally dig in was also a bad idea. 

When in doubt gather intel. With Autumn's help, a line of bees ran a kind of bucket brigade network down what I had dubbed Hell's Gate, and a sensor drone led the way. It was a pretty good set-up. I was getting clear visuals on my HUD, and as the tunnel was mapped Autumn updated the wireframe. 

I wondered how she was getting accurate positioning underground. Then it dawned on me: "Every new bee holds position at the end of the line. The helix gives you half a dozen reference points for each drone even around corners. You're using time-domain reflectometry and a lot of trig to position relative to the units at the entry, aren't you!"

The dunce-cap disappeared from Lego me.

"That's how you can fly them down there so fast."

The shaft descended straight as a ruler, a dark and foreboding passage carved into the earth. The walls were rough-hewn, streaked with red clay and flecks of decomposed granite that glittered faintly in the dim light. As the drone ventured deeper, otherworldly sensors told me the air grew cooler, carrying a faint tang of minerals. Easy to imagine the dry, musty scent of long-forgotten places. Descent was silent, save for the faint hum of the drone's rotors and the occasional creak of ancient timber overhead, groaning under the weight of the hill above.

Fourteen metres down, the tunnel levelled and widened, lurching left as if to guard its secrets from prying eyes. The air here was heavier, laden with a sense of abandonment. The passage opened into a much larger chamber, its walls no longer braced by timber but cold, unyielding concrete. The transition jarred, stepping from the realm of the natural into the domain of the deliberate, where men bent the earth to their will.

The room was vast; ceiling lost in shadow, littered with furniture and all the other vestiges of everyday life reduced to broken fragments and scattered debris. Rusted metal frames leaned drunkenly against the walls, and the remnants of wooden tables and chairs lay splintered on the floor, their surfaces warped and cracked with age. A faint trickle of water echoed somewhere in the distance, its source unseen, adding a ghostly cadence to the oppressive silence. At regular intervals, concrete pillars strove against the hill, cubist Atlas in silent rows.

For the life of me, I couldn't imagine why anyone would build such a thing in the middle of nowhere. It felt like a tomb, a place where time had stopped, the world above forgotten.

Inside two minutes I was looking at a dull grey wall with fibrous white tendrils falling into a shallow pool of slimy looking water across the bottom of what looked like an abandoned redoubt. This was curious considering the parched grass outside, but probably rainwater ran in and collected, evaporating slowly out of the sun and away from the wind. 

As my head turned, Autumn obliged with the camera. A faded Eureka flag adorned one wall, mildewed and tearing under its own weight. Clearly I was not the first to try to get out from under the watchful eye of the establishment. 

It took me a moment to realise there was a far exit, blocked by a grey wall that Autumn said was the borer.

> _This is perfect. I don't think it knows we're here._

"Or it's playing dumb and we're walking into a trap."

It was not lost on me that the borer's break for freedom ended right next to the symbol of our nation's ill-fated rebellion. I didn't know what this place was, but the flag gave me an odd sense of kinship with whoever built it, and I didn't want to destroy what remained of the redoubt. It felt like sacrilege.

"Autumn, what do we have that will kill it fast without much collateral damage? I don't want to make a mess here."

Oleksiy shouted. My focus shifted out of my camera-driven underworld and I realised he was calling me. Halfway around the hill the ground lifted and a fern-stalk thing unfurled, with a pod on top. It swelled and grew at a pace reminiscent of Jack and the Beanstalk, unreeling so fast that in minutes the pod was four metres up and rising. 

"It doesn't seem to be attacking. More like flowering."

> _Is it just me or does that sound like a really bad thing?_

At six metres growth slowed. Once tender fronds had a lean and hungry look about them and the pod was taut, with the gloss of an over-inflated balloon. 

The absence of ground units was odd and unsettling. Oleksiy climbed back into the Galya to cover me with the Gatling while I approached the stalk with my nun-blaster. At six metres I wasn't going to reach the pod so I lit up the stalk. 

The stalk was covered in hair so fine it was all but invisible and incredibly flammable. Crackling flame raced ahead of the gel, flaring yellow-blue. The stalk listed as lilac tongues licked the pod. The whole thing was surreal and I was already halfway back to the helicopter when it went. Whether it split or burst like popcorn is hard to say, but the sky was full of feathery... _seeds!_

> _Please tell me we didn't just throw a million seeds in the air._

The stalk burned furiously. It blazed like something _made_ for fire. Autumn pulled the bees out of the hill as fast as she could, but it was a lost cause. A rising column of hot air wafted thousands of the seeds higher and higher, carrying with them any hope that the chase might end today.

Back in the Galya, we rose in the loudest silence imaginable. Eventually Oleksiy engaged the autopilot and turned to look at me from his forward position.

"That caught all of us flat-footed. I take it you've never seen that kind of anti, Autumn?"

> _Never, though really it's not a surprising adaptation. There are dandelion equivalents on countless worlds. What I've never seen is a fire adaptation like that. I strongly suspect that if you hadn't torched it, the plant would have self-ignited in some way._

"Glad to hear that. It wasn't nice feeling outman&oelig;uvred by a pot plant."

> _Why would you expect it? Those feathery seeds look like they'd burn well, but they don't. That's the core of the adaptation. I've already reported this. We cannot allow this one to spread, it's too effective._

"Cannot allow it to spread? I think that ship has sailed."

> _Cannot allow it to spread from your planet._

I digested the implications of that for a while.
