"How much help can you give me?"

> _Could you be more specific? It depends on how many points and tokens you have._

"For starters you could tell me what that means. But I won't remember it the first thirty times, my short term memory is poor. What I need is constant reminding, which will annoy me, and books. I want a primer, a getting-started, a historical perspective on strategies and tactics and how effective they were. And something with profitability analyses of approaches, or better yet the Janet and John version with a top ten."

> _That's... not the usual starting point. I have 38927 matching works. 927 are translatable. You can't have the historical perspectives or the profitability analyses because they're all in a Class VII catalogue. There's a book on game theory applications that was written here on Earth by the Chessmaster but it's rather abstract. And there's a Janet and John with a top Sixty but it's ... marked as not for sale. There's no getting-started because that's part of my purpose.

"Quelle surprise! So we'll be playing guessing games. I'll formulate a bunch of strategies and you'll critique their likely effectiveness, profitability and dependencies, and then we can plan a shortest path with contingencies. 

> _You're not really a risk-taker, are you_.

"I thought you knew all about me."

> _Quite. Has it crossed your mind that this much planning makes you very predictable?_

"How long do most plans survive contact with the enemy?"

> _Minutes. So you don't really want a plan, you want a general strategy, a bunch of tactics for scenarios and when the shit hits the fan you'll throw it all out the window and wing it just like every other Vanguard._

"Something like that. But things will quiet down again and then we go back to the master plan."
