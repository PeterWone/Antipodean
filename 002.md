"How much help can you give me?"

> _Could you be more specific? It depends on how many points and tokens you have._

"For starters you could tell me what that means. But I won't remember it the first thirty times, my short term memory is poor. What I need is constant reminding, which will annoy me, and books. I want a primer, a getting-started, a historical perspective on strategies and tactics and how effective they were. And something with profitability analyses of approaches, or better yet the Janet and John version with a top ten."

> _That's... not the usual starting point. I have 38927 matching works. 927 are translatable. You can't have the historical perspectives or the profitability analyses because they're all in a Class VII catalogue. There's a book on game theory applications that was written here on Earth by the Chessmaster but it's rather abstract. And there's a Janet and John with a top Sixty but it's ... marked as not for sale. There's no getting-started because that's part of my purpose._

"_Quelle surprise!_ So we'll be playing guessing games. I'll formulate a bunch of strategies and you'll critique their likely effectiveness, profitability and dependencies, and then we can plan a shortest path with contingencies. 

> _You're not really a risk-taker, are you._

"I thought you knew all about me."

> _Quite. Has it crossed your mind that this much planning makes you very predictable?_

"How long do most plans survive contact with the enemy?"

> _Minutes. So you don't really want a plan, you want a general strategy and a bunch of tactics for scenarios. Then when the shit hits the fan you'll throw it all out the window and wing it just like every other Vanguard._

"Something like that. But things will quiet down again and then we go back to the master plan."

> _I know you won't like "Chief" or "Spartan" so how about -"_

"It's fun inside my head but if you try to Halo theme me... Look, it's already a brand, it belongs to a company. I may have an inner child but twelve was some time ago. I would like people to, don't you think from time to time we'll need people to take me seriously? If I let you have your way I'll end up with a stupid name like 'Gameboy'."

> _...so how about "Tacticus"? From those Pratchett books you love so much that you carted a complete collection of paperbacks, some of them first editions, I note, all the way out here._

"Maybe." Silence reigns, bar the creaking of suspension, as the car lurches down four hundred metres of winding and heavily eroded driveway to the track along the creek. The creek, unsurprisingly, runs along the bottom of the valley. Probably it _made_ the valley, in geological ages past. 

"Still a bit pretentious. And if I do happen to end up Halo themed by circumstances that totally had nothing to do with you, I will buy a Halo themed drone and make you introduce yourself as 343 Guilty Spark. And do the voice. And the 'hmm-ha-hmmmm, I am a genius.' thing.

...


I can hear you grinning. Stop it. That was a threat, not an offer. I'd like to point out that if you're Guilty Spark you'll never get to say 'Thanks for the tank, sergeant. _He_ never gets me anything."

> _...So we're going with a Halo theme then?_

"No."

> _Noble Six?_

"I- Begone, foul temptress! I suppose you think you're going to be Noble Actual?" We're nearly there. The valley road is in much better condition and it's not far home.

> _Well..._

"Careful, you might end up as Siri. Anyway, I've decided. I'm going to call you Autumn. As for branding, when there's enough points you're going to get me a new lumberjacket, a nice armoured one. Red-check, same as this. Waterproof. And leech repellent, fuck I hate leeches." I've been out of the car for six paces and already I've stopped one climbing my leg.

"I'm back! I see we need a new screen on the door. Autumn, can I afford anything that will get that stuff out of the carpet?" A very domestic looking spray bottle appears on the galley bench.

> _69 points remain. It's not a lot, and there's no doubt more of them munching on your forest. Shall we go hunting? I'd suggest a recon drone but we lack the budget._ 

"Put the kettle on, darl? I'll be back shortly, I'm just going to pull some weeds." There's no answer, which is a mild worry. I trot down to the food garden and sure enough she's defending it. Because in twenty hectares of forest, of _course_ the first thing they try to eat is the herbs and greens. "Another one of these Hummingbirds, please." Autumn obliges. A couple of potshots and Her Majesty is no longer frantically swinging my old cricket bat. "Here, use this instead."

"How do I reload it? There's no sight."

"Tap the side to turn on the laser dot. You don't load it, it's cheap because it's disposable. I'll give you something better when I have the budget. "

"Good. You can start by going up to the high creek and stop them eating my citrus."

On the way I see a cane toad and a murderpigeon trying to eat each other at the same time. Some leeches attempt to board and are forcibly removed. I wistfully imagine a bounty for killing them. Autumn snickers in my head. It's alright for her, they can't get to her. So gross.

The aforementioned citrus trees are actually quite well defended by chickenwire enclosures around star pickets, designed to keep wallabies and rabbits out. Steel wire has enormous tensile strength. Chickenwire is too thin and flexible to chew through it and claws just stretch it elastically. Four trees, partly gnawed, and five entangled and very frustrated... I don't know what they are. Weeds. Phut phut phut phut phut, five ex weeds. This is a great toy.

> _Stop looking so smug, it won't always be this easy._

A horrendous squealing and a racket through the undergrowth heralds the arrival of an angry sow pursuing a number five fleeing with a dead piglet. I'm straight up a tree before she decides I'm involved. Sows are terrifying. Half a tonne of angry motherhood, now with extra tusk, they and brown snakes are the only things in the bush scarier than me.

"How are we for points now?"

> _107, 112... When the piggie leaves we'd better give your partner two more Hummingbirds. And a caution to conserve. Or bring her with us._
