Sophia Hachia, duly appointed first contact and permanent project liaison, did not like the Vanguard. They gave off this vibe of not caring what you thought, and ran around acting like they were beholden to no-one. What _really_ got Sophia's goat was the fact that they _were_ beholden to no-one. You couldn't cut off their welfare or freeze their assets. Theoretically you could detain a tier one or two vanguard, but if you did you had to have an unbelievably good reason to get the rest of them to mind their own business. 

The only thing you could really do was undercut them in the media and make sure they didn't become popular the way things had gone in north America. Cascadia was the worst. "Samurai" were a popular phenomenon verging on cult.

"He has no regard for authority," she snapped at the corporate drone who'd just been making polite conversation. "The whole lot of them have been hiding out here in the sticks thumbing their noses at us for years. We ignored them because they were a harmless nuisance. Now they're armed to the teeth and that stupid fat hippie had the cheek to tell she couldn't allow a tier two artefact to fall into unsuitable hands. Who the hell gives half a dozen stealth drones to a fucking hippie!? Do you know what she does with them? She is using a key strategic asset to keep quolls out of her _chickens!_ If he doesn't need them his nation does. But when I asked for a meeting to discuss it, he said no."

"That _is_ his prerogative. The concept of ownership is fundamental to commerce. Property rights are sacrosanct." No mention of individual rights, why would anyone care about bollocks like that? But a government attempting to seize privately held assets? Disgraceful. The stuffed shirt shifted in his seat, clearly unsympathetic.

"I don't mean he wouldn't give up the drones. I mean he refused the meeting. And he gave guns- he gave a _rocket launcher_ to a _Russian_."

"Do you mean the Ukrainian? They're not _quite_ the same thing, you know. Had a little spat, I believe, did the Russians and the Ukraine." 

"Don't be obtuse, that political difference hasn't existed since the spillover from the Chinese incursion. They united to defend against the antis, just like everyone else. Ukraine, Russia, there's no difference any more."

"I'm not sure they agree with you. In fact, if you plan to _share_ that opinion with the Ukrainian, whose name is Oleksiy, then I should very much like to watch. From a safe distance."

She glared at him. "We have reason to believe that man is, has," she fumbled with her internal censor, wanting to make a point without breaching the Secrets Act, settling on "is a hitman."

"Oh, well. Better than giving it to the hippie. At least a hitman won't _accidentally_ shoot you."

"Do you think this is _funny?_"

"No. Well, a little. You shouldn't let him get to you. I'm quite sure he's doing it on purpose."

Sophia closed her eyes and took a deep breath. "Probably. Alright, I won't keep you. Thanks for listening to me vent. See you next Tuesday, if nothing else goes wrong." The corporate drone took his leave and she collected herself, trying not to dwell on the unmitigated temerity of Vanguards in general. Unruly creatures, they didn't seem to understand that their responsibility was to the commonwealth. It was one thing to fail to think of it for themselves, but to refuse their civic duty after it was spelt out for them... the whole lot of them ought to be in prison. She catalogued their sins in her orderly bureaucratic mind.

- Unlicenced possession of firearms.
- Possession of weapons of mass destruction.
- Disobeying a lawful police direction.
- Destruction of public property.
- Reckless endangerment.
- Use of firearms in a public place. 
- Arson.
- Resisting arrest.
- Assaulting a police officer.
- Numerous violations of the Secrets Act.
- Importation of controlled substances.
- Unlicensed practise of medicines.
- Importation, possession and use of unapproved nanotechnology, pharmaceuticals, firearms, vehicles, body armour, weapons, munitions, explosives.
- Violations of the Hate Speech Act.

Almost everyone violated the Hate Speech Act. The whole point of it was to provide an excuse to lock people up when they were a nuisance. First the government tried to appoint itself the arbiter of truth with the Misinformation and Disinformation Act, known as the MAD Act by the fools who couldn't see how important it was to maintain order. That was defeated in the senate, which was no surprise and a decoy to lull objectors into a false sense of security while they sneaked the Hate Speech Act through. The HSA was much more useful because you didn't have to argue about truth, you only had to find someone offended by it. It doesn't matter what you say, it will always offend _someone_.

At least most Vanguards had an excuse for acting like children - they _were_ children. This one was going on sixty and acted like _he_ was in charge. The disrespect didn't stop there. He kept addressing her as "Karen" and when she informed him that the proper mode of address was "Project Liason Hachia" or "ma'am" he started calling her "Your Bureaucratic Majesty". In front of her staff. Who looked like they were trying not to laugh. For which there would be _words._

It was outrageous. She was _genuinely_ offended, and couldn't even demand to speak to his manager.

Muttering tastefully euphemised imprecations under mint-scented breath, Her Bureaucratic Majesty daydreamed of satisfying days at the Department of Correctional Services, reviewing parole applications and making sure reprobates didn't get out of paying for their untidy ways.

The door opened, unbidden, and _he_ strolled into her office as though he owned it and sat on her desk. "You wanted to talk. You've got five or ten minutes before I have more important things to do."

Repressing her reflexive indignant sputter, Sophia showed her mettle by seizing the opportunity. "Something you do not seem to understand is that this is an Australian Government project under the auspices of CSIRO."

He completely failed to show contrition and backchatted her. "Something _you_ don't seem to understand is that this is a Protectorate research project run by an alien AI on private property and we only let you help because I didn't have enough points at the time and Autumn thought it would be good for terrestrial scientists to participate.

"I got a lot of points cleaning up batches one through nine. And a bunch of tokens, although Autumn used most of them on project stuff. I don't think she actually needs your people any more, she has these." I held my hand out and Autumn obliged, since we can always use more of them. A tiny drone with an uncanny resemblance to a bee fell into it. "That's why the stealth drones were surplus. So I gave 'em to someone deserving." 

"You gave a strategic asset to someone who needed a _fence!_"

"Quolls are smart, fast, sneaky, greedy and bloodthirsty. She _has_ a fence, and we got film of 'em getting in through a gap I couldn't put my hand through. It was our genius government decided to protect native animals but not people's livestock. So I gave her a couple of old drones that can track 'em and turn the laser down till it just hurts."

A vein pulsed in Sophia's head as her mouth opened and closed like an irate puffer fish. Where to begin? "Just the AI in those things makes them a controlled device. And they are _armed!_ Stealth technology is also controlled._ You need a permit for AI. You need a permit for armaments. You need a permit for stealth technology. You cannot _get_ a permit for stealth technology that defeats our military sensors. And you have given _twelve of them_ to an ageing hippie to defend _CHICKENS!_"

"Yep." He ostentatiously consulted his watch, got up and walked out. "Careful, you wouldn't want to explode without a proper permit."
