Sophia Hachia, duly appointed first contact and permanent project liaison, did not like the Vanguard. They gave off this vibe of not caring what you thought, and ran around acting like they were beholden to no-one. What _really_ got Sophia's goat was the fact that they _were_ beholden to no-one. You couldn't cut off their welfare or freeze their assets. Theoretically you could detain a tier one or two vanguard, but if you did you had to have an unbelievably good reason to get the rest of them to mind their own business. 

The only thing you could really do was undercut them in the media and make sure they didn't become popular the way things had gone in north America. Cascadia was the worst. "Samurai" were a popular phenomenon verging on cult.

"He has no regard for authority," she snapped at the corporate drone who'd just been making polite conversation. "The whole lot of them have been hiding out here in the sticks thumbing their noses at us for years. We ignored them because they were a harmless nuisance. Now they're armed to the teeth and that stupid fat hippie had the cheek to tell she couldn't allow a tier two artefact to fall into unsuitable hands. Who the hell gives half a dozen stealth drones to a fucking hippie!? Do you know what she does with them? She is using a key strategic asset to keep quolls out of her _chickens!_ If he doesn't need them his nation does. But when I asked for a meeting to discuss it, he said no."

"That _is_ his prerogative. The concept of ownership is fundamental to commerce. Property rights are sacrosanct." No mention of individual rights, why would any care about bollocks like that? But a government attempting to seize privately held assets? Disgraceful. The stuffed shirt shifted in his seat, clearly unsympathetic.

"I don't mean he wouldn't give up the drones. I mean he refused the meeting. And he gave guns- he gave a _rocket launcher_ to a _Russian_."

"Do you mean the Ukrainian? They're not _quite_ the same thing, you know. Had a little spat, I believe, did the Russians and the Ukraine." 

"Don't be obtuse, that political difference hasn't existed since the spillover from the Chinese incursion. They united to defend against the antis, just like everyone else. Ukraine, Russia, there's no difference any more."

"I'm not sure they agree with you. In fact, if you plan to _share_ that opinion with the Ukrainian, whose name is Oleksiy, then I should very much like to watch. From a safe distance."

She glared at him. "We have reason to believe that man is, has," she fumbled with her internal censor, wanting to make a point without breaching the Secrets Act, settling on "is a hitman."

"Oh, well. Better than giving it to the hippie. At least a hitman won't _accidentally_ shoot you."

"Do you think this is _funny?_"

"No. Well, a little. You shouldn't let him get to you. I'm quite sure he's doing it on purpose."
