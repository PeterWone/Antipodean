How are screws made?

This was the question currently occupying Forest's perennially overtaxed attention. He knew how to make one with a lathe, but obviously that was not the way of mass production. The valley had a voracious appetite for fasteners. Cubby-houses, then cabins &mdash; which are basically cubby-houses for adults. Sheds. Roofing. Flashing. Guttering. Water tanks sprouted like big plastic mushrooms. What idiot encouraged them to try their hands at building? Unfortunately, he knew the answer and couldn't really complain about it.

They were getting smarter about it, too. Heavy red clay was everywhere under the topsoil, and one enterprising couple was making bricks. More than one couple was gathering granite rocks and boulders. Stone cottages rose from the ridges, little castles claiming the land in silent defiance. Red bricks accented doorways and windows, each with a sturdy steel or timber lintel spanning the opening. In one case, someone had made a custom brick mould and an arch was under construction.

He wondered how they were dealing with the soil. Clay swells or shrinks with seasonal moisture, a terrible foundation for a stone building. No doubt Oleksiy would have had advice. He really _was_ a builder, among other things.

Curiosity got the better of him. Forest retreated to the mesh and started digging. It turned out that mass-producing screws was a marvel of industrial ingenuity. Most modern screws were made by cold heading: a coil of steel wire was fed into a machine that chopped it into short lengths, then smashed one end flat to form the head. The blank was then rolled between precision dies, which pressed the threads into the shank without cutting away any metal. This process was fast, efficient, and produced screws that were stronger than those made by cutting threads. Afterward, the screws were heat-treated for strength and coated to resist corrosion. There were endless variations—self-tapping, wood, machine, drywall—but the basic process was the same.

Forest watched a few old videos, marveling at the speed and precision. It was a far cry from turning a single screw on a lathe. He made a note to ask if anyone in the valley had ever tried making thread-rolling dies. It seemed like the sort of thing that would end up on his list, sooner or later. They _really_ needed a smith. Or three. This was worse: they could probably make screws, but how the devil would they make the dies?

Then there was the question of passivation. Galvanisation was simple but then they needed a supply of zinc. And there was nothing "just" about painting them; paint was a whole other ball of wax. Bitumen was the simplest answer but there wasn't any in the valley. There _was_ tin and lead, so probably zinc, but that meant smelting. It was all too hard.

He fantasized about a world of villages, each specialising in some aspect of technology. Mining, smelting, glass work. They wouldn't exactly trade, not in the money sense. They'd just give each other surplus, because people with too many oranges need screws, and a village can only use so many screws. It wasn't a bad idea, really. But there was no way the state would mind its own business while they set up like that. 

He imagined the 'screws' village mostly farming. In year four of their cycle, while their fields fallowed, they'd  make hardware, fed by stores propped up with gifts from other villages looking forward to a gift of hardware. Unlike the money driven world, people here were figuring out how to build things to last. He remembered an unfunny "joke" from a former life writing software: _There's never time to do it right, but there's always time to do it again._ A smile lifted his moustache. These people had found time to do it right. The irony was, they were all learning, so they'd probably also do it again. But better, which is what matters.

The range mothers tried their hands at pottery but it didn't pan out, the clay wasn't pure enough. So now their husbands were busy (re-)inventing a machine to turn it to running slop and sieve out the impurities. Their prototype worked and now they were figuring out continuous production.

Forest was very pleased about that; it deferred the need for glass.

That was the thing about the valley: nothing stayed impossible for long. Someone would mention a problem over tea. By the next week, three people would have half a solution and a fourth would be sketching improvements in the dirt. Progress was slow, sometimes maddening, but it was theirs. Every new tool, every clever fix, was a small act of creative defiance. We’re still here. We’re not done yet. 

Forest found himself oddly hopeful. Progress wasn't _really_ slow. The _first_ time humanity did this it took thousands of years. Maybe they’d never have a proper screw factory, or a glassworks. But they’d have something better: a place where people learned, adapted, and built for keeps. And if that meant doing it again, and again, and again — well, that was how you got good at anything worth doing.

It was a weird mix of high science and cottage industry. Boffins who'd never been outside in their lives were pulled into practical arguments. Dragged into the field to see problems _in situ,_ consulted for their theoretical understanding. For the first time in their lives they were getting a certain kind of respect from practical people, something they'd always craved and never admitted. And their respect for the doers also ballooned. It was a virtuous circle.

The work was hard, the days long. No-one even noticed; they were having the time of their lives. Sitting on a roof, watching, Forest spoke to Autumn, "We've created a monster." She responded by throwing mesh usage stats up on his visor. There were more hits on DIY fabrication than porn, and gaming traffic was almost non-existent. Forest could _hear_ her grinning.

"They're in sooo much trouble." She knew who he meant, and didn't respond to that.

A few days earlier, Eric had come to Forest with a request for approval to use his Vanguard points for exotic ammunition. Normally, Autumn's project points would have covered it, but demand was through the roof. The ground team had been relentless, scouring antithesis further and further afield, wiping out nascent hives as far away as Tenterfield. Forest was surprised they had the manpower to cover so much ground while still protecting the valley from its experimental hives.

Three weeks earlier: a festive pavilion in the guest carpark outside Oleksiy's home. The air was filled with the sharp crack-crack-crack of automatic weapons in burst mode, the sound bouncing up and down the entire valley. The mothers clustered around their thermoses, gossiping as they watched the distant figures on the range.

One mother, eyes wide, leaned in. "I can't believe Mick is back on the front line already, after what happened."

Another nodded, voice low. "He lost a chunk of thigh and — well, you know. Dogweed got him when their position was overrun. If the vehicle team hadn't pulled them out, and Forest hadn't been there..."

The conversation shifted, stories of Forest, Eric, and Oleksiy circulating — tales of their exploits, their no-man-left-behind attitude. There was admiration, even awe, in their voices.

One of the women, with a sly grin, said, "I'll tell you what, Forest is looking better every year. All that running around, or is it the good food and fresh air?"

The almost-bereaved woman, smug, chimed in, "Oh, it's the medicine. My man was back on his feet in two days. Standing at attention in three. And let me tell you, the first thing he did was scoop me up — just like that — threw me over his shoulder and carried me all the way to the bedroom. I didn't think he had it in him, not after what happened."

There was a beat, then laughter. "Standing at attention?"

She winked. "I was bow-legged for two days. Remember when I was 'sick'?"

The group erupted in knowing giggles, the crack of gunfire punctuating their laughter.

"But does it still _work?_"

She put her hand around her still flat belly, face unbearably smug now. She'd just been to the infirmary to confirm. "Oh yes, it works alright."

For a moment, the group was silent, then the congratulations came in a rush. Hugs, laughter, and a few mock-jealous groans. Someone promised to bring cake next week. Incredibly, this idea was rejected immediately; the kids had decreed that flour not sourced in the valley was unsafe and disgusting, astonishing their mothers with across the board rejection of bread and cake without a proper pedigree. The local substitutes were adequate thickeners but not yet a substitute for baking.

Another joked about starting a nursery for the next generation of ground team. The mood was bright, the camaraderie palpable, the sound of gunfire in the distance now joined by the cheerful noise of celebration. As the day warmed, Eric and Forest went shirtless. Mick too, they realised, as he replaced the targets. Many gazes lingered on the rippling muscle, speculating. Volunteers for front-line duty inexplicably went through the roof.
