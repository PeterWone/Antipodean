How are screws made?

This was the question currently occupying Forest's perennially overtaxed attention. He knew how to make one with a lathe, but obviously that was not the way of mass production. The valley had a voracious appetite for fasteners. Cubby-houses, then cabins &mdash; which are basically cubby-houses for adults. Sheds. Roofing. Flashing. Guttering. Water tanks sprouted like big plastic mushrooms. What idiot encouraged them to try their hands at building? Unfortunately, he knew the answer and couldn't really complain about it.

They were getting smarter about it, too. Heavy red clay was everywhere under the topsoil, and one enterprising couple was making bricks. More than one couple was gathering granite rocks and boulders. Stone cottages rose from the ridges, little castles claiming the land in silent defiance. Red bricks accented doorways and windows, each with a sturdy steel or timber lintel spanning the opening. In one case, someone had made a custom brick mould and an arch was under construction.

He wondered how they were dealing with the soil. Clay swells or shrinks with seasonal moisture, a terrible foundation for a stone building. No doubt Oleksiy would have had advice. He really _was_ a builder, among other things.

Curiosity got the better of him. Forest retreated to the mesh and started digging. It turned out that mass-producing screws was a marvel of industrial ingenuity. Most modern screws were made by cold heading: a coil of steel wire was fed into a machine that chopped it into short lengths, then smashed one end flat to form the head. The blank was then rolled between precision dies, which pressed the threads into the shank without cutting away any metal. This process was fast, efficient, and produced screws that were stronger than those made by cutting threads. Afterward, the screws were heat-treated for strength and coated to resist corrosion. There were endless variations—self-tapping, wood, machine, drywall—but the basic process was the same.

Forest watched a few old videos, marveling at the speed and precision. It was a far cry from turning a single screw on a lathe. He made a note to ask if anyone in the valley had ever tried making thread-rolling dies. It seemed like the sort of thing that would end up on his list, sooner or later. They _really_ needed a smith. Or three. This was worse: they could probably make screws, but how the devil would they make the dies?

Then there was the question of passivation. Galvanisation was simple but then they needed a supply of zinc. And there was nothing "just" about painting them; paint was a whole other ball of wax. Bitumen was the simplest answer but there wasn't any in the valley. There _was_ tin and lead, so probably zinc, but that meant smelting. It was all too hard.

He fantasized about a world of villages, each specialising in some aspect of technology. Mining, smelting, glass work. They wouldn't exactly trade, not in the money sense. They'd just give each other surplus, because people with too many oranges need screws, and a village can only use so many screws. It wasn't a bad idea, really. But there was no way the state would mind its own business while they set up like that. 

He imagined the 'screws' village mostly farming. In year four of their cycle, while their fields fallowed, they'd  make hardware, fed by stores propped up with gifts from other villages looking forward to a gift of hardware. Unlike the money driven world, people here were figuring out how to build things to last. He remembered an unfunny "joke" from a former life writing software: _There's never time to do it right, but there's always time to do it again._ A smile lifted his moustache. These people had found time to do it right. The irony was, they were all learning, so they'd probably also do it again. But better, which is what matters.

The range mothers tried their hands at pottery but it didn't pan out, the clay wasn't pure enough. So now their husbands were busy (re-)inventing a machine to turn it to running slop and sieve out the impurities. Their prototype worked and now they were figuring out continuous production.

Forest was very pleased about that; it deferred the need for glass.

That was the thing about the valley: nothing stayed impossible for long. Someone would mention a problem over tea. By the next week, three people would have half a solution and a fourth would be sketching improvements in the dirt. Progress was slow, sometimes maddening, but it was theirs. Every new tool, every clever fix, was a small act of creative defiance. We’re still here. We’re not done yet. 

Forest found himself oddly hopeful. Progress wasn't _really_ slow. The _first_ time humanity did this it took thousands of years. Maybe they’d never have a proper screw factory, or a glassworks. But they’d have something better: a place where people learned, adapted, and built for keeps. And if that meant doing it again, and again, and again — well, that was how you got good at anything worth doing.

It was a weird mix of high science and cottage industry. Boffins who'd never been outside in their lives were pulled into practical arguments. Dragged into the field to see problems _in situ,_ consulted for their theoretical understanding. For the first time in their lives they were getting a certain kind of respect from practical people, something they'd always craved and never admitted. And their respect for the doers also ballooned. It was a virtuous circle.

The work was hard, the days long. No-one even noticed; they were having the time of their lives. Sitting on a roof, watching, Forest spoke to Autumn, "We've created a monster." She responded by throwing mesh usage stats up on his visor. There were more hits on DIY fabrication than porn, and gaming traffic was almost non-existent. Forest could _hear_ her grinning.

"They're in sooo much trouble." She knew who he meant, and didn't respond to that.

A few days earlier, Eric had come to Forest with a request for approval to use his Vanguard points for exotic ammunition. Normally, Autumn's project points would have covered it, but demand was through the roof. The ground team had been relentless, scouring antithesis further and further afield, wiping out nascent hives as far away as Tenterfield. Forest was surprised they had the manpower to cover so much ground while still protecting the valley from its experimental hives.

Three weeks earlier: a festive pavilion in the guest carpark outside Oleksiy's home. The air was filled with the sharp crack-crack-crack of automatic weapons in burst mode, the sound bouncing up and down the entire valley. The mothers clustered around their thermoses, gossiping as they watched the distant figures on the range.

One mother, eyes wide, leaned in. "I can't believe Mick is back on the front line already, after what happened."

Another nodded, voice low. "He lost a chunk of thigh and — well, you know. Dogweed got him when their position was overrun. If the vehicle team hadn't pulled them out, and Forest hadn't been there..."

The conversation shifted, stories of Forest, Eric, and Oleksiy circulating — tales of their exploits, their no-man-left-behind attitude. There was admiration, even awe, in their voices.

One of the women, with a sly grin, said, "I'll tell you what, Forest is looking better every year. All that running around, or is it the good food and fresh air?"

The almost-bereaved woman, smug, chimed in, "Oh, it's the medicine. My man was back on his feet in two days. Standing at attention in three. And let me tell you, the first thing he did was scoop me up — just like that — threw me over his shoulder and carried me all the way to the bedroom. I didn't think he had it in him, not after what happened."

There was a beat, then laughter. "Standing at attention?"

She winked. "I was bow-legged for two days. Remember when I was 'sick'?"

The group erupted in knowing giggles, the crack of gunfire punctuating their laughter.

"But does it still _work?_"

She put her hand around her still flat belly, face unbearably smug now. She'd just been to the infirmary to confirm. "Oh yes, it works alright."

For a moment, the group was silent, then the congratulations came in a rush. Hugs, laughter, and a few mock-jealous groans. Someone promised to bring cake next week. Incredibly, this idea was rejected immediately; the kids had decreed that flour not sourced in the valley was unsafe and disgusting, astonishing their mothers with across the board rejection of bread and cake without a proper pedigree. The local substitutes were adequate thickeners but not yet a substitute for baking.

Another joked about starting a nursery for the next generation of ground team. The mood was bright, the camaraderie palpable, the sound of gunfire in the distance now joined by the cheerful noise of celebration. As the day warmed, Eric and Forest went shirtless. Mick too, they realised, as he replaced the targets. Many gazes lingered on the rippling muscle, speculating. Volunteers for front-line duty inexplicably went through the roof.

"You're pullin' me leg." Forest eyeballed Shorty, amusement lighting his face.

"Nup. Weren't you always telling _me_ the fundamental forces of the universe were stupidity, greed and horniness?"

"So no amount of logic worked but Mick swaps a keg for a six pack and we're all go."

"Yep. Well, not _just_ Mick. Every time the sun comes out you buggers have yer shirts off at the kids' range. Why d'yer think the mothers all turn up? You patched Mick up. He wasn't bleeding when we took 'im home but his missus, what's her name, Jennifer or somethin'. She thought she was gunner spend the rest of her life lookin' after a cripple. Nanites did what nanites do, and two days later he chucked her over his shoulder, carried her up the stairs and bonked her halfway into next week.

"Why do _you_ know this?" Forest looked confused.

Shorty roared with laughter. "Mate, you must be the only person she _hasn't_ told. Pleased does not cover it. And my missus tells me she's up the duff, too. Mick's missus, not mine. I hope."

"Well," Forest recovered, "That's one way to recruit, I s'pose."

He changed the subject and brain-dumped the hardware problem on Shorty. 

"We probably don't need to smelt iron, there's so much of it lying around. A decent smith can make billets. But then we need to make wire, which isn't impossible. But you need tool steel dies to form the wire. How the bloody hell do we make _those_? I'm really starting to worry that it's too much."

"Weren't you talking about a bunch of villages mostly growing food but also having a specialty and doing that in a fallow year?"

"Yes?"

"If we set up all that shit you were talking about we'd make them by the tonne, right? So in this hypothetical fallow year we make shitloads of screws, rack 'em, pack 'em and stack 'em, and swap surpluses like you were on about."

"So?"

"So the dies don't have to be replaced all that often. How many screws do you think we _need?_"

"Shitloads. Take a look at how often people go into town for hardware. Even just a little deck, 2.4 square with ninety mil' planks. If you do it to code there's one every 400 which gives you seven joists hanging from the bearers. With a 4mm gap that's 25 planks over seven bearers with two screws per intersection is fifty by seven is 350. There you go, 350 screws for a piddly little deck. Most of the cottages I've seen were more like four by ten metres which is about..." his mouth moved, silent calculation. "'Bout seven thousand screws."

Shorty thought about that for a while. "I don't reckon it's normal. We're all building stuff, houses and sheds. It'll never stop, but it'll switch from construction to maintenance, y'know. It'll slow down a lot. Plus, I was looking at those links you gave me, the Amish. A lot of what they make doesn't use screws, just nails and not a lot of those. It's bloody clever stuff. I never thought I'd be saying this to you, but you're thinking about this all wrong."

Forest stared at him for a while. 

"I reckon you might be right. Still worries me, though. We are buying a _lot_ of hardware. It's going to draw attention."

A bee landed on Shorty's phone, which flickered to life. Autumn's voice lilted out of it.

> _Trixie wonders if you ever plan to empty the can._

"It's only half-full, what's her rush?"

> _Tomorrow is Sunday. You are entertaining half the ground team._

"Only half of 'em? I thought they'd all turn up for lamb on a spit."

> _Group 2 is clearing the hills around Glen Aplin._

"Left the gate open, did we?"

Autumn sniffed. The phone went dark. It was amazing how she managed nuanced presence, even through a speaker.

"Right, I'm off."

"Like a bucket of prawns in the sun."

On his way home Autumn piped up in his visor/

> _Are you planning, at some point, to **read** any of the material in the Reboot catalogue that I so thoughtfully provided? You don't need to work it all out yourself, you know._

"Yep. After I come up with a half-arsed plan that won't work I'll look at theirs and pinch the good bits. Then I can pretend I'm a genius."

Never one to let anything as trivial as common sense get in his way, Forest continued investigating while he went home, learning about wire drawing. He came up with a plan for a simplified semi-manual simplification of the industrial process with wire running back and forth between two drums. With each pass you changed the die and the direction, producing finer and finer wire and periodically harvesting a desired size.

Autumn showed him a similar but fully thought out solution in one of the books in the Reboot catalogue. This did nothing to diminish his satisfaction with his own plan. If anything it tipped him over the edge from confident to flat out smug.

> _I really don't see why you're so pleased at having spent days fretting about this when you could have just read the book._

"The problem, Autumn, is what I like to call Roman Pot Syndrome. The Romans produced excellent ceramics. As the empire collapsed and shrank there was a surplus of fine ceramics that spanned generations. There was no value in learning to make what could be had for no effort. So the technology was forgotten. And one day there were no more surplus pots and no-one who knew how to make them. The catalogue is nice but reading about it in a book and doing it are very different. We are in dire peril of suffering Roman Pot Syndrome with things like screws and wire."

> _I would say this has **already** happened. You didn't know, and you, Forest, are far more likely to be interested in this sort of thing than most._

"I dimly recall learning about wire-drawing at school. Or it may have been university. It's obvious that rolling the threads into wire would harden them. All the crystal boundaries get shoved together."

> _Knowing that is **not** normal._

"Knowing that _wasn't_ normal in the screwed up, centralised nonsense I left behind. Look around us, kiddo. Look how much fun these people are having now that they've reclaimed their lives."
