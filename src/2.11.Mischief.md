Forest stood on the ridge, the cold wind tugging at his jacket. Below him, the valley stretched out in serene defiance of the encroaching world. Autumn's voice broke the silence.

> _"All drones are in position. GPS transponders are active and broadcasting."_

"Are the offsets randomised?" Forest asked, his eyes scanning the horizon.

> _"Not just random, they vary continuously. No two drones are misdirecting in the same way. Each transponder introduces subtle, unique errors in positioning data. Surveillance drones will map the valley as a chaotic mess of conflicting coordinates."_ 

Forest nodded. "Good. We don't want them figuring out the pattern."

Autumn's lilac form shimmered into view beside him, her expression one of quiet satisfaction.

> _"It's like creating an artificial Bermuda Triangle. They'll think their systems are malfunctioning, and any attempt to map the valley will be useless."_

"How long until they notice?" Forest asked.

> _"Hard to say. The errors are subtle enough to avoid immediate detection. By the time they realise something's wrong, they'll have a mountain of bad data to sift through."_ 

Forest allowed himself a small smile. "Good. Let them waste their time. Every second they spend chasing ghosts is a second we can use."

He paused, frowning slightly. "You know, the deflections are neatly limited to the valley. They'll work it out pretty quick once someone notices. You're not that innocent, Autumn. What do you intend to do when they figure it out?"

Autumn dissolved into a shimmering lilac chesire cat grin. 

> _"Oh, I have a plan."_ 

A holographic aerial photo montage appeared in front of Forest, starting with a close-up of the valley. The image zoomed out slowly, showing the surrounding terrain, then the region, and finally the clouds above. As the view expanded, the clouds formed letters: **"MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS."**

Forest chuckled, shaking his head. "Subtle as ever."

> _"I learn at the feet of the master,"_ Autumn replied, her grin widening.

Behind him, lurker drones sat in trees, charging in the sun, watching and waiting for the moment to weave an invisible shroud of misdirection.

> _Does the valley have a name? All I could find on record is a surveyor's description, "Running Creek". This is a weird country. You have 832 "Sandy Creeks", 481 "Stony Creeks" and 2079 "Dry Creeks"._

"We never named it. We just call it "the valley". And "the creek".

> _Can I name it?_

She spun up her presence drone and it dropped almost to the ground. Peter Jackson's vision of Galadriel violated copyright in shimmering lilac. She held up one hand and a bee switched its lamp to maximum, so that a tiny star drifted gracefully to settle in her palm, dimming and blazing again like some tiny beacon of hope. Forest burst into laughter.

"Lothlorien? Because your magic hides it from the unwelcome? Janna would _love_ that."

> _Good, I shall start my campaign with her._

Three small, fast lurker drones descended from hidden places among the trees, orbiting her head.

> _RÃºmil._

They all paused. One bobbed.

> _Orophin._

Another bobbed.

> _Haldir the Marchwarden._

The last did a little loop. They ascended, vanishing from mortal sight.
