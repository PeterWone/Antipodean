# 3.11. Boom Crash Opera

The morning was typical Valley autumn. Crisp air, bird song, and the distant sound of someone splitting wood. What wasn't typical was the red and white striped boom gate blocking the road at the valley entrance, or the government sedan parked beside it with two very uncomfortable-looking men in suits.

Rebecca spotted it first on her way back from the post office run, pulling up short enough to make her tyres complain. She stared for a long moment, processing the implications, then reversed carefully and drove back to spread the word.

By the time Forest arrived, half the valley had gathered. Not standing around gawking — that wasn't their way — but finding reasons to be nearby. Oleksiy sat on his motorbike by the gate, engine running, having a pleasant conversation with the guards about the weather. Trix perched on a fence post with her camera, documenting the installation with artistic enthusiasm. Ken leaned against his truck cab, radiating the patient menace of a man who'd done bad things to worse people in dark and nameless places. 

The boom gate itself was substantial — proper heavy-duty industrial equipment, not some hardware store special. Solar panels powered the electronics. A small gate-house housed what looked like monitoring equipment. Someone had invested serious money in this operation.

Forest parked and walked over, boots crunching on gravel. One of the guards stepped forward—young, nervous, trying to project authority he clearly didn't feel.

"Sir, I'll need to see some identification and ask about the purpose of your visit."

"Visit?" Forest's eyebrows climbed. "Son, I live here. Have done for thirty years. You're blocking my driveway."

"Sir, this is a controlled access area. All movement is subject to monitoring and approval."

"Controlled by whom?"

The guard consulted his clipboard with the desperate hope of someone looking for divine guidance. "Department of... ah... Special Projects, sir. Under the authority of—"

"Eric!" Forest called out. "Eric, get over here!"

Eric materialized from wherever spooks materialized from, looking like he'd rather be anywhere else. The guards straightened—they recognized authority when they saw it, even if they didn't quite understand the chain of command.

"Forest, I can explain—"

"I'm sure you can. But first, where's Sophia?"

"She's..." Eric paused, clearly weighing his words. "She's in a meeting with her superiors. About operational parameters."

"Right. So this wasn't her idea."

"No. Definitely not her idea."

The crowd was growing. Not just valley residents now—word was spreading, and people were arriving from neighbouring properties. The kind of people who took a dim view of government interference and weren't shy about expressing their opinions.

Forest studied the boom gate with the attention of someone evaluating a problem. "Solid bit of kit. Must have cost a fair dinkum. What's it supposed to accomplish?"

One of the guards found his voice again. "Sir, it's a security measure. To ensure proper control of—"

"Security against what? We had nine Class One hives in this valley six months ago. Know how many we have now?" Forest held up a closed fist. "Zero. What exactly are you securing us from?"

The guard had no answer for that.

"Eric, whose bright idea was this?"

"Minister's office. Someone decided the valley needed better... oversight."

"Oversight." Forest rolled the word around like he was tasting something unpleasant. "Tell me, what happens if there's an emergency? Medical evacuation? Fire? Flood?"

"There are provisions for—"

"Provisions." Forest's voice had dropped to the conversational tone that made smart people nervous. "Provisions that depend on permission from people who might be having their morning coffee in Canberra while someone bleeds out on this side of the gate."

Trix's camera clicked steadily. Ken had moved closer, close enough that the guards were definitely aware of him. Oleksiy still sat on his bike, but his radio was squawking with traffic from the other stations.

"Now here's what's interesting," Forest continued, speaking to Eric but pitching his voice to carry. "Yesterday I couldn't have told you how many trips we make to town in a week. Couldn't tell you what we buy, what we need, what we depend on. But this..." he gestured at the boom gate, "this is going to give us excellent data."

Eric blinked. "Data?"

"Oh yes. See, every time someone wants to go through this gate, they'll need to explain where they're going and why. What they're buying. Why they need it. What they can't do without." Forest's smile wasn't entirely pleasant. "Very educational."

One of the guards was starting to look worried. "Sir, the purpose isn't to—"

"Isn't to what? Isn't to make us catalog our dependencies? Isn't to force us to examine every trip, every purchase, every connection to the outside world?" Forest's voice was warming up. "Because that's exactly what it's going to do."

Rebecca had arrived back with Sheila and the other range mothers. They stood in a loose group, not saying much, just watching. The kind of watching that made bureaucrats sweat.

"Eric, I need to ask Sophia a question. Can you get her on the radio?"

"Forest, she's in a closed meeting—"

"Then interrupt it. Because either she's in charge of this operation or she isn't. And if she isn't, I need to know who is."

Eric pulled out his satellite phone with the reluctance of a man defusing a bomb. The conversation was brief and largely one-sided. When he hung up, he looked grim.

"She's driving out here. About an hour."

"Good. Because I want to know if this gate works both ways."

"Both ways?"

"Does it keep people out, or does it keep people in?"

The guard tried to answer. "Sir, it's purely for access control—"

"That's not what I asked." Forest's attention fixed on the young man like a hawk spotting a rabbit. "If I want to leave the valley, do I need permission?"

Silence stretched. The guard looked at his clipboard, at his partner, at Eric. Anywhere but at Forest.

"I... I'd need to check with—"

"You'd need to check." Forest nodded slowly. "Right. So we're not talking about security. We're talking about control."

The crowd was definitely bigger now. Valley people, neighbours, even a few from town who'd heard something was happening. The kind of gathering that could turn ugly very quickly if handled wrong.

"Forest," Eric said quietly, "maybe we should wait for Sophia—"

"Oh, we'll wait. But while we're waiting, I'm going to ask these lads some questions. Starting with: who gave the order to install this thing? Who signed the paperwork? Who's paying for it?" Forest's voice carried across the crowd. "Because someone decided the people of this valley needed to be caged, and I want to know who."

Trix lowered her camera long enough to call out: "Forest, should I send these photos to the papers?"

"Not yet, love. Let's see what Sophia has to say first."

But his tone suggested that courtesy had limits, and those limits were being tested.

The boom gate stood across the road like a red and white declaration of war. And from the look on Forest's face, that declaration had been received and understood.

An hour was going to feel very long indeed.

And then it wasn't. Eric's radio crackled. 

"Echo charlie, this is zero alpha. Sierra hotel hit the panic button, we're on our way to site bravo."

"Roger zero alpha, echo charlie out." He turned to Forest. "At a guess, it wasn't her idea." 

Eric swept the gathered with his eyes. He spoke in a stage voice. "No point hanging about. I'm going to get something at the caf."

Nodding in the direction of their admin buildings and the cafeteria, he spoke softly to Forest: "Walk and talk." 

Out of earshot, Forest shrugged and grinned. "Autumn, I assume you have control of that gate by now?"

> _Yes, they've finally plugged it in._

"Outstanding." He whistled sharply and stood in the middle of the road until enough people arrived. A bee landed on his shoulder. 

"I don't think that gate is Sophia's idea. Play their silly game for now. But if they jerk you around, do this," he made a dismissive rising flick gesture, like chasing away an annoying fly. "Autumn will open it for you."

There was laughter and the mood eased.

"And if that doesn't work there's always the Gally."

"Not all of us know how to fly it!"

"Oleksiy thinks _I_ don't know how to fly it."

"I have a silly question," said Scott, who really should have been doing chores.

"Yes?"

"Why would we need a checkpoint to find out what we buy in, when not a leaf shall fall but Autumn shall know?"

Finger-counting began.

"First, well spotted, we don't. Second, they will not have the satisfaction of imposing it if we say it serves our purpose. Third, please look unhappy and grumble when you use it. It clearly hasn't occurred to them that the only thing we use the road for is cars on shopping trips and I'd like to keep it that way. Seriously, when was the last time you _walked_ out that way?"

The boy looked amused. "Never?"

"How does the ground team travel?"

There was a moment's silence. "Why do we call them the 'ground' team? They _fly_ everywhere."

"It's historical. And when they get there they do still conduct ground operations, even if these days they always have close air support."

"Now, I have a question for you. Your mother took your phone but I heard you talking to Aiden. How?"

The kid hesitated.

"You're not in trouble. At least, not with me. I just want to know."

"She didn't tell you?"

"Who?"

"Autumn. I thought she told you everything."

"Not everything. I wouldn't have time. And she's big on privacy. She'll rat on you to your parents, but that's because your mother has a right to know. And even then only if asked, unless she's genuinely worried about you."

"OK, cool." He gathered himself. 

"So, I asked her could she connect to the phone. She laughed and said 'among other things'. So I said, I hear the bees whispering sometimes. Oh good, she said, not everyone does. I said, can you land one on my ear and one on my lip, or nose or something, and like, make a phone call? And she did. It's so cool!"

"Thank you, Scott. Autumn, is there a reason you never told me about this very useful option?"

> _You have your visor. You don't need it._

"Reasonable. But I wonder do you realise what a rod you have created for your own back... 'switchbitch.'"

> _I beg your pardon?_

Forest sighed. "When I was in Signals, `switch-bitch` is how we answered call requests from enlisted men when we were on the switchboard. I'm pretty sure you've created a monster."

> _I was already hearing it. Especially the older ones. You have no idea how much bad poetry can be averted by the simple expedient of getting them together for a snog._

"Aiden?" Forest called after the departing lad.

"Yes?"

"Spread the word, please. That gate is _not_ to disappear in the night, no matter how entertaining it might be. Alright? Not just yet. I would like you all to play dumb and docile for a while."

> _Or pranks. What will you tell the boys?_

"The truth, of course. We aren't ready yet, we need time. I'll explain it like sitting tight in a hunting blind. They'll probably ask how I knew and I'll tell 'em that too: it's what _I_ wanted to do."

> _Good choice, that will speak to them._
