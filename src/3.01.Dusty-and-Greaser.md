People milled and faffed about. Forest was not know for patience. He climbed up on a bin.

"You're adults, you don't have to do what I say. But in a couple of minutes that shelter will lock again and if you're still outside we aren't going to be here to protect you. Make your choices **now!**"

The milling stopped and people shuffled back through the door.

"Right," Dusty slouched up, grinning. "How do yer want ter handle this? Go up one end and do a walk-through?"

"That's not the worst idea I ever heard. Sophia, this is your stomping ground."

"Tamworth is all over the place, I wouldn't know where to start. I don't think the bees have the operational range for it. Autumn?"

> _Lucky for you, we stocked the Galya with fast recon drones. We'll have go head back and let them out, but it's probably the best plan. There are six drones, six chargers, and a dozen batteries. The bees are good for high resolution, but not for distance._ 

"Boomer, reckon you can coordinate with, what's yer name, miss?"

> _Autumn. And if Forest has no objections I think we can get a sweep pattern going and feed your bots target queues. I'm not sure about a full cleanup, though. We have to get back to our own home. There's three hives and no Vanguard presence. Which isn't as bad as it sounds, but it's not great._
