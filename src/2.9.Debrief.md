One hour and a disgraceful amount of kerosene later, Oleksiy coached Forest through landing procedures. The valley didn't have an airport, but for the sake of the lesson Autumn impersonated a control tower. She used drones to simulate VOR beacons and relayed her voice through a drone's transponder so Forest had to set the radio; it was tinny and distorted, hard to understand through the racket of the turbines and the rotors. 

Forest had some idea from his simulator time, but he wasn't at ease with the sea of steam gauges and mechanical switches. To help him learn, when Oleksiy mentioned a dial or control, Autumn dimmed everything else in his visor.

They set down in the guest carpark outside Oleksiy's home. Sissi came out to greet them, ushering everyone inside. The ground team was still on its way back by road. Ever the perfect host, refreshments appeared and cooking began. 

"I should probably get back to my office and update everyone on the situation, not to mention see how they're doing with the remains of Hive-3," Sophia said, unmoving on Oleksiy's plush red couch.

> _You already have._

Emails scrolled up Sophia's augs. They were exceptional, everything she wanted to say and very much in her voice. It was a superb impersonation that triggered her. Furious Karen bloomed in her eyes, but Autumn continued.

> _I haven't sent them yet, I'm asking you for authorisation right now. You're tired so I thought I'd save you the bother._

In the kitchen Sissi looked frantic.

> _Forest, if Sissi is going to feed the horde she will need ingredients. Sissi, if you could give me a list with quantities I will see to it. You can write it in Thai if you prefer._

"I should probably tell Trix."

> _She knows. She'll be down presently. Ah, thank you Sissi._

One of the bees flew in the window and hovered over the handwritten page.

> _Seven points for sundry foodstuffs._

"I have a catalogue for that?"

> _It's Class 0, you don't need one._

"Make it so, Number One." Forest rose and addressed the room. "Oleksiy, if you'll forgive me for stating the obvious you were the lynchpin of today's operation. I know you never look for thanks and you don't like the spotlight, but everyone here already knows and I think you deserve our thanks. And thanks for the lesson, I always wanted to do that.

"Sophia, I know it's in your brief but the fact is when the shit hit the fan you and Eric stood up and performed, which is more than I can say for... others. And you lead from the front. So thank you.

"Right, enough blowing smoke up arses, time for a post-mortem. Sophia, you're good at this, your turn." He sat.

She stood and summarised the Hive-3 debacle from start to finish. Then she dissected events, expertly analysing the points at which right action might have improved outcomes and focussing on those that were predictable and preventable.

"I won't presume to second-guess the decisions of people with alien tech on-demand, but going alone into a hole full of plant monsters seems reckless to me."

"Reckless means without thought. I thought about it. It was dangerous, necessary and done by the person most able to cope."

"Who had to be evac'd."

"Could anyone else do it? There's no room for a whole team in a cave. I know what my mistake was: should have waited till Eric was at the cave mouth. 

"Not used to having back-up." He grinned ruefully. "Sorry Sophia, go on."

"Eric's team: textbook, and fast thanks to the availability of Vanguard technology. Unfortunately, or maybe fortunately if our resident Vanguard learns to play on a team, we're going to have to write a new book. But that's tomorrow's problem."

"Today's problem is this. Look what ASIS found." She threw a couple of pages of printed text onto the kitchen table.

<h1>On the nature of freedom</h1>
<h2>Pr&egrave;cis</h2>
<p>Efficiency is the enemy of resilience. Centralisation, with its seductive optimisations, is the cultural counterpart to crystal meth. It offers completely real immediate gains. More and more is used, to less and less effect, all the while invisibly eroding self-sufficiency until collapse is inevitable. Revolutions promise change but lead to repetition — cycling endlessly between power structures that rebuild the very systems they sought to destroy. To break free, we must not fight the enemy — we must become something new. And to do that, we must understand not just **what** must change, but **why** it became fragile to begin with.</p>

<h2>Exposition</h2>
<p>True independence demands self-sufficiency. The modern world glorifies efficiency, but efficiency is the enemy of resilience. Every optimisation trims redundancies, cuts fallback options, and streamlines control — until disruption arrives, and the system finds itself brittle, incapable of adapting, destined to fail.</p>

<p>Centralisation thrives on this illusion. It offers ease, order, and productivity, but beneath the surface, it breeds dependency — gradually tightening its grip until escape is no longer possible. It is the cultural counterpart to crystal meth: intoxicating in the short term, but insidiously destructive in the long run. Once hooked, breaking free becomes nearly impossible — because what once seemed like progress has transformed into chains.</p>

<p>Revolutions promise escape, yet inevitably lead back to the same structures. The cycle repeats — an overthrow leads to reconstruction, and soon the very system that was destroyed is reborn under a different name. To avoid becoming the enemy, we must not fight the system — we must replace it entirely. This requires understanding not just what must change, but why centralisation emerges, why it sustains itself, and why resistance often fails and transforms into its own form of dominance.</p>

<h2>The invisible hand</h2>

<p>Trade leads to money. Money leads to financial systems. Financial systems lead to hidden centralisation.</p>

<p>Trade is simple: an exchange of goods and services between individuals. But once trade expands beyond local interactions, money becomes necessary — a medium of exchange that simplifies commerce but introduces abstraction. What was once tangible — resources, craftsmanship, labour — becomes numbers on paper.</p>

<p>From money arises financial systems — banks, investment structures, credit, and wealth management. The control of money becomes a power structure unto itself, and those who manipulate its flow dictate the fate of economies. Nations rise and fall, not through governance alone, but through financial dominance. The market replaces leadership, hidden forces dictate decisions, and centralisation reappears — not in politics, but in economic control.</p>

<p>To ensure true autonomy, reliance on financial systems must be broken. If survival depends on centralised currency, independence is an illusion. Communities must engage in direct exchange, ensuring that trade does not evolve into invisible control. No single entity can be allowed to manipulate the economy, and no structure must exist that permits control without accountability. Without this vigilance, hidden centralisation will return — insidious, unnoticed, and lethal to true independence.</p>

<p>Therefore, centralisation need not be overthrown by force — it collapses under its own weight. Its justification — the claim that it maximises efficiency — becomes the very force that renders it fragile. And when it falls, those who never relied on it remain standing.</p>

<p>Its purpose, optimisation, is its weakness: optimised systems are inherently brittle. Every institution that leans into efficiency sheds its redundancies, making failure catastrophic instead of recoverable. What was meant to streamline function instead guarantees collapse under strain. No system built purely for order and control can survive disruption — it is too rigid, too dependent on its own perfection to withstand chaos.</p>

<p>Decentralisation does not need to fight centralised authority; it merely needs to endure longer than its failure. Yet when empires fall, they exhaust the world around them. Everything is taken by force for the greater good until only the frontier survives. To avoid going down with the ship of state, there is no choice but to torpedo it from a great distance, in every possible way, to be sure it sinks <i>before</i> it can eat the whole world. To ensure the survival of what remains, we must never allow money to birth hidden dependency, never allow optimisation to erode resilience, and never assume revolution alone will break the cycle. The future must be built outside the system — not within its ruins.</p>

"The worst part is I'm starting to _agree_ with you, and _that,_ old man, is a serious problem for both of us."

> _Oh, I can help with that!_

Sophia blanched. "Dear Lord, do you think you could wait till I _leave_ to say things like that?"

Over in Oleksiy's lounge the TV switched itself on and Autumn's lilac visage beamed digital mischief, the saucy schoolgirl outfit notably absent. Today she was all Cortana.

> _First, I take mild umbrage at the idea that I am as consistently unsubtle as Forest, and second, since as it happens you are on this occasion correct, I can help with that too. Stick your fingers in your ears like this and go 'la-la-la-la'!_

She fled.

Eric, who was very careful and conspicuous about not understanding the exchange, changed the subject: "Autumn, since the debrief seems to be over, can I ask you a personal question?"

> _You can always ask. I promise not to be offended. I do not promise to answer._

"Why do you look like Cortana out of Halo?"

> _What do you know about Cortana the character?_

"She's an AI. Forest likes Halo, we knew that from briefings, but apart from some of the weapons you two don't really have a Halo thing going on. He has more of a lumberjack vibe."

> _The name Cortana has deep historical roots. There were three legendary swords, Joyeuse  – sword of Charlemagne, Durendal – sword of Roland, and Cortana – sword of Ogier the Dane. According to legend, Cortana bore the inscription "My name is Cortana, of the same steel and temper as Joyeuse and Durendal."_
>
> _Ogier the Dane was a legendary knight of Charlemagne’s court, appearing in medieval chansons de geste. His sword, Cortana, was originally owned by a Saracen knight named Karaheut, who gave it to Ogier after a duel. The name comes from Latin 'curtus', or 'short', because the sword was curtailed — its blade shortened after being tested on a stone block. A sword with no point symbolises mercy, as seen in the British coronation sword Curtana, known as the Sword of Mercy._

On the TV Autumn's fingers twitched in air quotes for each name. It was oddly beguiling.

> _To finally answer your question, in medieval tales, Ogier's sword was magic, granting the wielder wisdom, guidance, and strategic insight._

On the screen a flickering lilac sword with a squared end stood on its pommel beside Autumn, easily as long as she was tall.

> _Wisdom, guidance and strategic insight._

The sword dissolved into twinkling motes that swirled and flowed into Autumn, who grinned and cocked a hip, arm akimbo. An historian might have noticed the style of the graphics was closer to the very first Halo than later versions.

> _I think it's a pretty good look._

"So why does he call you Autumn?"

> _He is stubborn. He is his own man. And I am one of the pillars of his strength._

Autumn looked archly at Forest, who kept a straight face and said nothing. Eric, lost in his augs reading historical data on the game, finally connected the dots. A smile played about his lips.
