Forest strode into the classroom, boots echoing on the old linoleum. The teacher, Ms. Carter, paused mid-sentence, marker hovering over a half-finished diagram of the Roman Empire.

"Excuse me, Ms. Carter. Would you mind if I spoke with your class for a while?" His tone was polite, but there was a glint in his eye that suggested mischief.

She hesitated, then nodded. "Alright, Forest. We were talking about why civilisations rise and fall."

Forest smiled, folding his arms. "A favourite topic of mine. Now, I know you've all heard the usual reasonsâ€”barbarians at the gates, plagues, bad luck, maybe a volcano or two. But let me put a question to you, and to Ms. Carter: can you name a single civilisation that collapsed, not by conquest, for a reason that doesn't boil down to centralisation?"

Ms. Carter frowned thoughtfully. "Centralisation? You mean, when too much power or decision-making is concentrated in one place?"

"That's it. When everything gets run from the top, the whole system gets brittle. One bad decision, one greedy hand, and the whole thing can come down. Decentralised cultures bend, adapt, survive. Centralised ones shatter. But maybe I'm wrong. Anyone?"

A student piped up, "What about the Black Death? That wasn't anyone's fault."

Forest nodded, encouraging. "Or was it _everyone's_ fault? You all hang out with Janna. Tell me why we don't engage in monoculture."

"Monoculture is stupid! That's just begging for something to eat your crop."

"Are you _sure_ monoculture is stupid? Wheat is a giant pain in the arse to harvest. Unless you put all of it in neat rows. Then you can build a machine to cut the seed heads off way faster." 

"Are you saying Janna is wrong?"

"No. Janna knows that, but she also knows the consequences aren't worth it. She grows other things instead. People who fall into the centralisation trap have to drench their crops with bug poison."

"How do they get it off before you eat it?"

"What an interesting question. Does that strike you as the sort of thing a corporation would worry about?"

They looked sick.

"Ewww."

"Does that mean flour is poisonous?"

"Depends where it comes from. Wheat flour that was bought in, probably. The local flour is made from millet and sorghum bulked out with potatoes. We tried bananas but they don't grow well up here."

"But what's that got to do with the Black Death?"

"Cities are monocultures of humans. One disease gets into them, like the wheat, conditions are perfect for it to spread. The other problem with this centralisation is decisions are made far away, no flexibility. Here in the valley, if you get sick you can just stay home and leave a note on the door. Your friends and neighbours will look after your gardens while you get better."

Ms. Carter considered, then said, "I suppose it's not always so clear-cut. Sometimes it's a mix. But I see your point."

Forest grinned. "It's never simple. People are clever, and they find ways to dodge the obvious. But the pattern's there if you look."

He let the silence stretch, then changed tack. "Ms. Carter, you've been in the valley a while now. How do you find the culture here? What stands out to you?"

She relaxed, thinking aloud. "It's... different. People show up with baskets of fruit, or eggs, or bread. There are bonfires, festivals, people helping each other with fences or gardens. It's generous, but not in a showy way. Just... normal."

Forest nodded. "And do you find it an expensive place to live?"

She blinked, puzzled. "Expensive? I..." She trailed off, frowning. "Now that you mention it, no one ever asks for money. Not for the eggs, or the bread, or even the firewood. People just... give. Or trade, sometimes, but mostly give."

Forest smiled, a little wryly. "It's easy to miss, isn't it? You get used to it, and then you realise how strange it is compared to everywhere else."

Ms. Carter looked at him, thoughtful. "I suppose I do. It's a good kind of strange."

Forest tipped his hat. "That's what I hoped you'd say."

He turned to the class again, and grinned. "Right, you pack of reprobates&mdash"

"What's a reprobate?"

"Ask Ms Carter after I leave. So! How many of you have been learning to shoot with Oleksiy? Hands up who is."

Twelve hands shot up.

"And how many of you were told by your mothers to stay away from him?"

Twelve hands stayed up. The kids attached to them looked had the grace to look guilty.

"I thought so. Do you understand _why_ your mother wants you to stay away from him?"

Most looked uncertain. An older boy volunteered, standing, "She heard he was an assassin for the Russians. She thinks he's a killer."

"She's both right and wrong. He was. He's here because he decided not to be that man. I have a little note here for you each to take home. It's for your mum to read. You can read it if you like, in fact I think you should read it together. After that, your mother will make a decision." His tone darkened. "Your mother raised you from birth. She gave up sleep and years of her life to make you the men and women you are yet to be. She cares about you more than anyone else in the world, and until you are adults you _will_ treat her instructions with respect. Are we clear?"

They looked chastened, verging on fear. Forest's directed violence was legend. They'd never heard of him hurting a person but he looked furious.

The sun came out from behind his eyes and the easy smile returned. "If she says no, your final court of appeal is to ask her to talk to me about it. But her decision after that will be final. Got it?"

They nodded, silent.

He left the class in a gentle hush, the students and their teacher quietly turning over the questions he'd left behind.

"Miss, what's a reprobate?"

She laughed. "Forest is. With any luck you'll turn out just like him."

Later that night, a small boy on his way to bed turned to his mother and announced that when he grew up he was going to be a reperbate and blow up monsters. For emphasis he threw a plastic dinosaur at the floor and said "BOOM!"
