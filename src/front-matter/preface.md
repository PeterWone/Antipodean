# Preface

It started as a couple of chapters so I could test a book compiler I was writing that constructs a traditional book from a set of Markdown chapter files. This was set in the Stray Cat Strut universe, which is well adapted to fanfiction with one's own characters and has a prolific ecosystem of interconnected tales. The vast majority of these are written by what one might describe as the rainbow club, so my own tale was deliberately satirical by the simple expedient of a white male protagonist, phlegmatic, unsympathetic and near the end of his life. 

The other major difference was that my protagonist lives in the country. For reasons set out in Stray Cat Strut most of what remains of North America is fortified cities. But the setting I chose is on the far side of the planet. Old, tired, nutrient poor and something of a death-world already, this mutes the threat posed by the alien plant monsters of Stray Cat Strut to the point where a rural setting is possible. Originally this was just me being contrary, but it became pivotal.

The original work wasn't deep. Like other SCS fanfiction, it was escapist power fantasy. But I rather enjoyed writing and things got out of hand. A few sample chapters grew and grew. To give it more depth I went back and grounded the landscape of the tale in Australian current affairs, projected forward into a controlling dystopia; not the moustache-twirling sadism Orwell painted but just as pervasive and dreary.

Then a week after I wrote a formative political event, it actually happened. A _week_. This greatly disturbed me, but it also made me aware I might be on to something. And so, in the medium of a power fantasy, I began to explore what was going wrong, and why. This is ground long trod, though not in the context of the 'Lucky Country,' but where I leave Orwell behind and break new ground is in having an answer for it.

What emerged was a story about more than antithesis and space magic. It became an exploration of why civilisations collapse—not through external conquest or natural disaster, but through a pattern as old as the pyramids: centralisation plus the separation of benefit from consequence equals inevitable decay. Egypt, Rome, Ming China, the Spanish Empire, the British Empire—all fell to the same fundamental mechanism.

Unlike those who came before us, we can see the pattern. We can choose differently. We can build distributed systems that preserve accountability, networks that resist capture, communities that innovate without stagnating. The technology exists. The principles are proven. What's missing is the will to choose resilience over convenience, autonomy over security, responsibility over comfort.

There is hope, and it doesn't require the space magic of the story. It just requires us to get off the treadmill.
