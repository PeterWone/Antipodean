For a simple man who just wanted to be left in peace, Forest had a lot to ponder. Suppose the state was ... out of the picture. It might not be self-sufficient, but it did manage trade with China, and shipping both ways.

He _really_ didn't want to get involved in that.

"Autumn, if I took out the state, that would stop trade. Which would immediately bring attention from trade partners, specifically the US and China."

> _Yes. We can't conceal the fall of a nation precisely because we can't continue the large scale extraction. Do you have an answer for this? You can't act unless you do. A good answer._

"They're too big to fight so we'll have to play them off against each other. If I have to invite the wolf in I'd prefer Americans. They speak English, more or less, and they're greedy and stupid, which makes them predictable and easier to manipulate."

> _That is an arrogant, insulting, undiplomatic and gross generalisation that oversimplifies the matter._

"Alright, their greed makes them stupid. You love it when I cut to the heart of things."

> _I do! So rugged, so manly._ Autumn swooned theatrically.

He rolled his eyes. "At any rate, _we_ can't continue the extraction, but we could invite American corporations to do it. The hardware's already there, they basically have to come maintain and operate it. 

"The hard part will be making sure they're here and settled in before the Chinese realise there's anything to oppose. At some levels that's not hard, just frame it in terms of opportunity. The greedy buggers will fight each other to be first. At other levels there's a risk the US government will tattle to ours."

> _You have your answer then. Send the invitation while the dust is settling, and make it clear they have to be in place fast if they want to play finders-keepers. Also make it clear they have to honour the contracts with China if they don't want a war._

He snorted. "They won't resist. Americans don't care who pays so long as someone pays. They'll show up with bells on."

He leaned back, considering. "The main difference is, at first the corporations won't be trying to govern us. They'll just want the resources. We'll have some time before anyone tries to play king."

> _Let them focus on profit, not power. The longer they see this as a business deal, the longer you stay out from under someone's thumb._

"There's no difference, Autumn. The point of profit is the gathering of power." He stood and paced. "We should set the tone from the get-go. Take names and scare them regularly."

> _Heads on spikes outside your gates, that sort of thing?_

"Don't be ridiculous.

"Heads on spikes outside _their_ gates."

> _Oh yes, for point three milliseconds I forgot I was dealing with Captain Subtle._

"Diplomacy is the continuation of war by other means."

> _Clausewitz was an ass. Appropriately, you are quoting ass-backwards._

"Jokes aside, it's a divide-and-conquer thing. To defeat them as a block would be pyrrhic. They have to each personally know what I care about and live in terror of crossing me, while not feeling threatened while they stick to the terms. Every so often someone will try their luck and every so often there will be a new head at the gates."

This is just my first thoughts, of course, but I'd like to make the terms: "Operate the mines to the end of the contract at the contract rate then fuck off home."

> _That just puts the problem off. If they do that and leave, you have a power vacuum. People on thrones will sit there drooling at the thought of all those resources lying about undefended. And it's not only a question of greed. From a strategic perspective that's actually a threat situation._

"Then we'd better be ready to defend it. Buying time improves that as a story."

> _Yes, it does. I'll think about it._

"What about the classic strategem of sowing discord in their own ranks?"

> _Among the corporations? Or do you mean the big players themselves?_

"Both. If the US and China are busy watching each other, they're not watching us. Feed their suspicions, nudge their egos, let them trip over each other. The more they compete, the less they cooperate â€” and the less they notice what we're doing."

> _Dangerous game. But if you can keep them distracted, it might work. Don't get caught playing both sides, Captain Subtle._

"This task requires subtlety, charm, tact, unparalleled intellect and a Class III Network Intrusion Catalogue."

> _Flatterer._

"Who says I'm talking about you? If you wanted compliments you should have worn the miniskirt."

> _Try talking to your resident bureaucrat about this strictly hypothetical scenario. Ultimately, it **is** an administrative problem._

"Dear Sophie, I have demolished your home. Please clean up the mess I have made."

> _I knew you had it in you._
