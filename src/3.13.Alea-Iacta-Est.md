Sophia found Eric in the workshop behind Ken's place, helping Ken's boy rebuild a small engine. The kind of domestic scene that would have looked perfectly normal to anyone passing by. Which was exactly the problem.

"How's the carburetor coming?" she asked, settling onto an upturned crate.

"Flooded again," Eric said, not looking up from where he was showing the boy how to adjust the float. "Third time this week. These old two-strokes are temperamental."

"Bit like reporting schedules," Sophia said casually.

Eric's hands stilled for just a moment. "Yeah, well. Some things need more attention than others."

The boy, maybe twelve, was completely absorbed in the mechanical puzzle before him. Eric let him work, offering guidance but not taking over. It struck Sophia how naturally he'd fallen into the role - part teacher, part older brother, part patient technician. When had that happened?

"Your mum's probably wondering where you got to," Eric told the boy eventually. "Why don't you head home for lunch? We'll tackle the timing this afternoon."

The boy grinned and ran off, leaving them alone with the smell of oil and the distant sound of someone hammering metal.

"Cute kid," Sophia said.

"Yeah, he is. Reminds me of my nephew." Eric wiped his hands on a rag that had seen better decades. "What's on your mind, Sophia?"

"Just wondering how your reports are going. Mine have been... challenging to write lately."

Eric glanced toward the open doorway, then at his hands. "The more I see, the less there seems to be worth reporting."

"Some things are better left unsaid."

They sat in comfortable silence for a while, listening to the valley's afternoon soundtrack - distant voices, the hum of workshop tools, someone playing softly. Living there changed people. They stopped playing the radio and started playing intruments. Radio was blaring ads and shallow soulless manufactured music. No-one out here wanted to listen to angry men chant about slapping their bitches, in the peace and the quiet it was just wrong. Like the afternoon peace made the conversation they weren't quite having feel heavier.

"You ever think about what happens when someone starts asking harder questions?" Sophia asked finally.

"Every day." Eric set down the rag and looked at her directly. "You?"

"Every night when I'm trying to figure out what to write that's true but not... complete."

"How long do you think we can keep dancing around it?"

Sophia shrugged. "Depends on how long it takes them to notice that their expensive, highly-trained operatives seem more interested in rebuilding carburetors than reporting intel."

Eric's laugh was dry. "When you put it like that, it sounds pretty damning."

"Doesn't it just." She picked up a wrench, turning it over in her hands. "I'm not sure I care anymore."

That sounds dangerously close to choosing sides."

"Maybe. Or maybe I already chose and I'm just now admitting it." She set the wrench down. "What are you going to do when they figure out we're not the same people they sent here?"

Eric was quiet for a long moment, his gaze drifting through the doorway toward the valley beyond. "I suppose that depends on what they decide to do about it."

"Yeah," Sophia said softly. "I suppose it does."

She left him there with his thoughts and the half-rebuilt engine, walking back toward her office through a place she thought of as _home._ 

"So many," she said, remembering places she'd dwelt. Memory lingered on Stewart street, overlooking the harbour. She'd loved that place, imagined it was home. But this place loved her back. Her choices were already made. She realised they were made a long time ago, in Glen Innes. They were doomed, she was desperate. She asked her enemy for help and he left his garden untended while they delivered a miracle to the helpless. All that remained was guilt &mdash; not hers &mdash; and consequence.

"They're coming," she whispered, wondering what to do. A bee lit on her shoulder, a show of silent solidarity. 

In the days that followed, she wore her armour. It didn't make her feel safer but it did make her feel more ready. At first people asked where the incursion was. "Not today, not tomorrow, but soon," she said. "And here. When they come, there will be a reckoning."
