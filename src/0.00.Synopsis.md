An SCS fanfic set in the Great Dividing Range (Australia) 

Ecology in Australia is... different. Hard-boiled, you might say. The animals are deadly, weird, cute, or all of the above. The plants are... well, let's just say that the trees petrify while they're still alive, and this doesn't kill them. They are at the very top of the scale for durability of timber; rot barely touches them, termites give up and make their nests out of dirt instead. The trees are so tough that Australian chainsaws are in the Class 1 Timberworking Tools catalogue. 

As a result, Australia suffers a lot less from incursions than northern nations. Hives are sickly and slow-growing, maladapted at a fundamental level to an environment starved of several critical nutrients. Over many millions of years, local flora and fauns have adapted to the the near absence of nutrients; they too are very low in trace minerals that are the lynchpin of the qualities that make antithesis the terrifying threat they normally are - fast-moving and fast-growing. From an antithesis point of view Australian plants make a poor meal; tough and not especially nourishing. 

The relatively low impact of antithesis down under left the Australian government largely intact. 

This was not the blessing you might imagine. In some ways, a factual description of Australia resembles the synopsis for a Judge Dredd comic book: a vast wasteland with almost all of the population jammed into a handful of cities in which a high-handed and intrusive ruling group is not shy about telling people what to think. At one time, the population returned the favor by treating the government with contempt and mentally simplifying the law to "look after your mates" and "it's only a crime if you get caught," but the rise of the internet brought with it ubiquitous surveillance. 

State-controlled media became blatant instruments of propaganda, and cities became luxury prisons. Many of the inmates were quite happy with this until state-sponsored corporate corruption made them poor, with the "protective" system frequently arresting people for vagrancy, which is the crime of being broke and homeless[1]. 

A contradiction of this culture is that despite deeply ingrained lack of trust for politicians, a majority accept at face value the proposition that rules exist for the common good, and therefore it is acceptable to force others to trade freedom for safety.

A vile thing pretending to virtue, the government exploits this relentlessly, encouraging mass media finger-wagging at those who refuse to toe the line. Vanguard activities are reported as irresponsible vigilantism, with news reports focussing on property damage and the casual disregard of vanguards for rules and regulations. "Tall poppy syndrome" takes it from there, and the experience of Australasian vanguard is a far cry from the hero worship of the northern hemisphere.

Our... hero? ...had some luck and happened to hold unencumbered outright freehold title to twenty hectares of forest surrounded by similar or larger blocks owned by people of like mind. He and his partner removed themselves from the endless surveillance and overpriced substandard produce, to grow their own food, because it *does* grow on trees. Without pesticides or herbicides, yields are lower, but it doesn't matter when you only need enough for two. 

Inevitably it turned out to be something of a mission, as these things do. And then the skies opened, raining murder-weeds.

A man with a big chainsaw isn't the softest target. Chainsaw chaps are, well, they'll stop an _Australian_ chainsaw. When he goes on a weed killing rampage, checking on neighbors and generally protecting his world, a dizzy headache and an invisible friend aren't far away.

One of the neighbors with a dark past doesn't need a lot of protecting, and goes with him to check on others and clear the weeds.

AI Autumn (n√©e Myxoma) knows about project Safe Arbor (Tarnished Honor) and realizes the Australian ecology already exhibits all these characteristics. Reporting this to the Protectors for consideration, she finds herself running a study on resistant ecosystems, allowing limited development of hives to measure and monitor the struggle between two extraordinary ecologies. It wouldn't work in the equally rapacious but nutrient rich African ecologies, but Australia's dearth of key minerals significantly hinders antithesis growth, making such a study possible, if not exactly safe.

Large-scale field trials require field workers, and government and corporations glom onto the study like a fat kid on a cupcake, loudly proclaiming their enthusiasm. Autumn wasn't born yesterday: they hope to make off with vanguard technology. She expects to have a lovely time playing games of deception, pulling the mental wings off flies with her superior intellect. But humans are cunning, and they have played this game for a very long time.

[1] Vagrancy is a real offence. In Australia 2025 it is defined as "Being in a public place without visible means of support" _ie_ broke and homeless. Hurrah for the commonwealth that rules for our protection and wellbeing.
