A long time ago in a university refectory far far away, a young man completely failed to wear a lumberjacket on account of it being two decades in the future. He sat eating dreadful fried food with his friends. They rambled about lectures and their social lives, and periodically played on the pinball machine in the corner. There was a jukebox too. This was so long ago that it was a true jukebox, full of vinyl records. Computers were a thing at this time, but personal computers were still a novelty. The controller in the jukebox might have been digital. It certainly had a mind of its own, and it seemed to like Jimmy Barnes' _No Second Prize_ and especially The Go-Gos' _Our Lips are Sealed_. But the sound was muddy, and the young man in the latent lumberjacket (which was a lot cleaner on account of never having been worn) thought it was "Alex the Seal." Eventually someone disabused him of this, but he didn't let that slow him down; "Alex the Seal" was far more amusing.

An astonishing amount of water flowed under various bridges, sometimes with frightening force, and an old man in a filthy, battered lumberjacket stood in the cafeteria of a modular building welcoming an industrial chemist named Alex, who thought he might be able to help them with seals.

The Adams-esque absurdity was not lost on Forest, who owned all five volumes of the Hitchhiker's Guide trilogy. He thought about sharing this and decided to reserve eccentric weirdness to another day.

"Sheila tells me you belong here, you just haven't realised it yet."

Alex didn't seem to know how to react to that.

The awkwardness stretched into silence. 

"Come for a walk. Grab something to eat on the way, if you like. What have we got today, Sally?"

A small, feminine bundle of enthusiasm bounded into action.

"You have got to try these! They had another go at a flour substitute. It doesn't work for bread but _oh my god I have missed almond shortbread!_" She bit one, communing with it for a moment before remembering she was getting someone _else's_ snack. Back she went, stuffing the rest into her mouth and wrapping one each in a napkin for them. 

Alex accepted his portion with studied grace, watching Sally, who was oblivious to her own charms and overflowing with enthusiasm for the ongoing flour replacement project started by the valley kids.

"Thish," she swallowed, "is all his fault."

Forest looked quizzically at her.

"Barged into a class, gave an impromptu lecture on the perils of monoculture and accidently caused every child in the valley to reject flour while he got half of them in trouble with their mothers." She waved at a sign on the counter, which read "NO BREAD OR PASTRY, ASK A KID WHY".

"They got themselves in trouble. Deceiving your mother never ends well."

"Yeah yeah. It certainly worked out well. That's why you're here, Alex. He accidentally created the Range Mothers."

"The 'Range Mothers'," repeated Alex. 

"They'll crack," said Forest, tone matter of fact. "Kids'll see to that." He gestured at the target at the end of the caf.

"Range!" he bellowed, lifting the bow off its rack on the wall and taking an arrow. He gave it a couple of seconds and loosed an arrow. "Ten. I'm out of practice." He put it back and bellowed "Closed" before fetching the arrow and putting it back, belatedly remembering that this too was eccentric weirdness. Fortunately Sally was attractive and hadn't flinched, and Alex's instincts required him to be calm in front of her.
