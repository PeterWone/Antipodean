**Interview Subject:** Janna Miller  
**Interviewer:** Emma Whitfield (Age 15)  
**Date:** [Current Date]  
**Location:** Janna's nursery, beside the pig enclosures

**Emma:** Could you tell me your name and what you do here in the valley?

**Janna:** I'm Janna Miller, and I run the nursery here. Though most people just call me the pig lady, and I wear that title with pride. My sows are magnificent creatures — intelligent, protective, fierce when they need to be. People fear them because they don't understand them. Size isn't aggression; it's capability.

*[Background noise: Lisbeth's voice calling "Here, Hettie! Here girl!" followed by the contented grunting of pigs and a disconcerting scrunch of pumpkin.]*

Much like the valley itself, really.

**Emma:** I heard the antithesis destroyed your nursery. How did you survive that?

**Janna:** I'm not wealthy. Never have been, probably never will be. The nursery business keeps me fed and pays the bills, but there's never much left over. When the antithesis ate a season's worth of work, it nearly broke me. But this place doesn't let people fall. Forest and Autumn didn't just replace my Hummingbird — they gave me five more and helped rebuild better than before. That's what community means: shared struggle, shared success.

*[Sound of small feet running, then Lisbeth's delighted squeal: "The baby goats are so fluffy!"]*

**Emma:** What about Hettie? Everyone talks about your sow surviving the attack.

**Janna:** When Hettie came home after the antithesis attack, I cried. Not just because she survived, but because she represented hope. Life finds a way, even in the worst circumstances. The piglet that survived — probably by staying close to mama — is thriving now.

Animals understand things humans forget: family matters, loyalty matters, fighting for what you love matters. Hettie could have run anywhere, but she came home. That's wisdom cities can't teach.

*[Lisbeth appears at the fence: "Miss Janna, Hettie wants to show Emma the piglets!" Janna smiles: "After we finish talking, sweetheart."]*

**Emma:** Tell me about the van. Dad says it's... interesting.

**Janna:** *[Laughs]* My van is old, ugly, and unreliable. It's also mine, paid for with honest work and maintained with stubborn refusal to give up. In a world where everything is leased, licensed, or controlled by someone else, owning something outright is revolution.

When I drive past the government complexes in their shiny vehicles, I smile. Their equipment comes with strings attached. Mine just comes with character.

**Emma:** What's it like working with the soil here?

**Janna:** The valley soil is challenging — ancient, mineral-poor, demanding. It teaches humility and respect. 

**Emma:** Is she...

**Janna:** Riding a goat? I find it's best not to think too hard about it. Where were we? Yes, my nursery specializes in native plants that thrive in these conditions. Settlers keep trying to grow European vegetables and flowers, then wonder why they struggle. I teach them to work with the land, not against it.

*[Distant quacking from the duck pond, followed by Lisbeth's excited chatter to the ducks.]*

**Emma:** But how? It's taller than she is!

**Janna:** He kneels and she walks up his horns. Don't look at me like that, I warned you not to think about it. If your head hurts, take it up with the goat. Though I'll warn you, he's a stroppy old bastard.

**Emma:** I heard you got in trouble for using military drones to protect chickens?

**Janna:** *[Chuckles]* Damn quolls killed seventeen good layers in one night. The drones were Forest's idea. He said it was no problem, he had better ones and the blue lady took care of it. All I know is they fly, they shoot and you can't see 'em. Sophia had a fit about that. Apparently they're military-grade stealth drones. To her, it was waste of strategic resources. To me, it was a favour from Forest. Worked, too, unlike _some_ of his ideas.

Look, quolls are native and protected and cute as hell. They're also chicken killers. I wasn't about to start shooting them, but I wasn't going to lose more birds either. The drones scare them off without hurting anyone. Problem solved.

Besides, they were Forest's drones and he gave them to me. We don't need anyone's permission for that. Fortunately she seems to have come to her senses.

**Emma:** Do you think of yourself as a teacher?

**Janna:** Not really. I just have answers people need. When new families arrive in the valley, they end up here learning about local conditions, appropriate plants, and practical living. I've become unofficial orientation coordinator without trying.

City people are useless with anything that grows. They're used to buying solutions instead of growing them, to convenience instead of actually knowing how to do things. But they learn, or they leave. The valley doesn't suffer fools.

I help someone choose the right tree for their soil, I'm teaching them to read their land and work with what they've got instead of fighting it. Basic stuff, really.

*[Lisbeth runs up again: "The piglets are sleeping in a pile! Come see!" Then runs off without waiting for an answer.]*

**Emma:** What about the valley kids? Do you work with them much? My little brother comes up here a lot. He won't shut up about it.

**Janna:** When they come here I put them to work. Can't do that without teaching a few things. Except Lisbeth. She teaches me. They listen because I know things worth knowing, not because some institution certified my expertise.

**Emma:** How do you see money and economics here?

**Janna:** Money is a tool, not a goal. It's useful in town but we live in a different world here. All that pressure to accumulate wealth for its own sake is why city people are half mad.

When I auctioned that first empty Hummingbird, the money mattered less than the proof that our community values people who actually do things over people with fancy certificates. They didn't want me 'in business', they wanted me _in the valley._ And I'll tell you why, or one example. You know that orchard he loves so much, the trees that bend with fruit every winter?

**Emma:** Yes? Mum takes me to jam day sometimes.

**Janna:** I put them in, not long before your dad joined the ground team. And I go down then every autumn and prune them. Forest doesn't have the sense to do it. He's all, 'it was covered in bloom,' soft-hearted romantic twit that he is.

**Emma:** What do your pigs mean to you?

**Janna:** Everything: independence, intelligence, fierce protection of family. No tolerance for threats. They're not pets or livestock — they're partners in making this place work.

City visitors see my pigs and get scared or disgusted. Valley people see what they actually are: waste disposal, soil improvement, security system, and emergency food if things go really bad. It's all about knowing what you're looking at.

*[Lisbeth's voice, more distant now: "Bye-bye duckies! Bye-bye chickens! I'll be back tomorrow!"]*

**Emma:** What do you think the valley represents for the future?

**Janna:** Every plant I grow, every pig I raise, every person I teach is keeping this valley strong. I'm not just running a nursery. I'm helping people remember how to be real.

When the outside world goes to hell, we'll have food, medicine, materials, and know-how. Not because we're doomsday preppers, but because we never stopped being connected to the land and each other and the things that actually matter.

*[Lisbeth suddenly appears beside us, cradling a duck in her arms with what looks like a rat perched contentedly on her shoulder. Two minutes ago she was sitting on the ground between a sow and her piglets without a murmur of protest from a creature that threatens me if I so much as walk up to the fence.]*

**Emma:** Is that a _rat?_

The bees whispered and Janna knew.

**Janna:** No, it's a bilby. Where did you find that, sweetheart?

**Lisbeth:** *[To Janna]* She was eating a spider! It was big and hairy!

**Lisbeth:** *[To Emma]* Janna knows _everything_ about plants! They make sugar from sunshine and water and car-bang dioxide using photosilliness! And she talks to the animals too! Don't you, Miss Janna?

*[Janna looks slightly embarrassed but amused.]*

**Emma:** *[To Lisbeth]* Yes, that's right. And they make the oxygen we breathe too!

**Lisbeth:** No they don't! They make some but at night they use it up again because they're still alive but there's no sunshine so they hafta use the meta-, the metabollo-, the other way, same as us. It's _dirt germs_ that poop out oxygen!

**Janna:** *[To Lisbeth]* The sugar oxidation metabolism, yes. And cyanobacteria, yes. Sweetheart, I think your mum's here to pick you up. *[To Emma]* This little patch of the valley is my proof that people can live well without wrecking the place. Every good garden, every healthy pig, every working ecosystem shows that there's a better way. Also proves that the best place for a goat is on a barbeque spit.

The antithesis forced humanity to evolve, but we were overdue anyway. We'd forgotten how to live with our environment instead of bulldozing it. Maybe we needed a good kick in the arse.

*[Interview concludes as Lisbeth's mother Carol arrives to collect her. Lisbeth carefully returns the duck to its pond and somehow coaxes the bilby back to wherever it came from, then calls out farewells to all her animal friends.]*

---

**Interviewer's Notes:** Janna really lights up when talking about her plants and animals. Throughout our conversation, she kept one eye on Lisbeth, making sure she was safe around the larger animals. There's something almost magical about how well Lisbeth gets along with all the creatures here — even Hettie, who Janna says doesn't usually warm up to strangers. 

The most remarkable moment was when Lisbeth casually walked between Hettie and her piglets (something that would normally be extremely dangerous) and emerged completely unharmed, then appeared at our interview holding a duck and with a bilby sitting on her shoulder like it was the most natural thing in the world. When she insisted that Janna "talks to the animals," I couldn't help but wonder if she was projecting her own unusual gift. The whole property feels like a working ecosystem where everything has its place and purpose. 

Though Lisbeth may be confused about who talks to the animals. Last semester I read a book by Marion Zimmer-Bradley about the Arthurian legend, through the eyes of Morgana. It's hard not to see Janna as a priestess, and Lisbeth as a little nature goddess. When I got home I checked. Lisbeth was right. The Amazon isn't the lungs of anything.
