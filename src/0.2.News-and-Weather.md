The traffic was heavy. She sat there watching old wipers smear drizzling rain across the windscreen and crawled toward the lights. On the radio a rich baritone explained why high prices were the other party's fault. She snorted and muttered under her breath that it certainly wasn't anything to do with _your_ party selling the grid to the Chinese and the power generation to someone else.

The news came on. Interest rates were up. Again. She arrived at the lights and put her blinker on. In the supermarket carpark the rain abated, a small mercy. There wasn't much in the ironically named fresh fruit and veg section. It was all a bit limp and sad. Avocados were four dollars each. "I'm fairly sure these things _do_ grow on trees," she muttered.

The egg section was nearly empty. She remembered something about bird flu and the government ordering vast numbers of birds destroyed. Naturally the only producers still in the game were large corporations. Demand exceeding supply suited them just fine.

Organic apples... one package left, sixteen dollars for a kilogram of small and probably tart and floury jonathons. She bought them anyway, consoling herself that having their own chickens kept the bugs out of her kitchen garden and meant that unlike most people they had fresh protein every day. 

It wasn't strictly organic but they weren't surrounded by farmland so it was a pretty good approximation. She managed to rescue the birds when the fire-ant control board turned up without warning and sprayed everything with pyriproxyfen. It killed the neighbour's dog the first time they came but under the Biosecurity Act 2014 resisting the poisoners just gets you arrested and they do it anyway. She was halfway convinced it was a pretext for shutting down non-corporate agriculture. 

The trick was to fly under the radar. Selling the eggs would attract attention. Smart people quietly traded produce with people who had something else, like Kelly's mango tree.

She got home and started dinner. Her husband arrived from his own commute about twenty minutes later, bringing in the mail. It was a letter from the council, a two thousand dollar fine for keeping poultry in a residential zone.

"At the price of eggs we might as well pay them and ignore it. At least we _have_ eggs."

"Not according to this."

She was outside in a flash, the screen door slamming behind her. The whole wall of the chicken run was torn off. Broken eggs, bedding and feathers scattered the ground, trampled in.

"Since when is this a residential zone? It's fucking rural. That was the whole point of moving way out here."

"We have 28 days to pay."

"Bastards! God I hate them. What if we ignored them? It's not as though they can come and take the chickens now."

"Let's see... first, SPER will suspend my driving licence. Then they'll try to put a garnish&eacute; on my income. All this paperwork will incur fees, so the amount will go up and up, and they'll charge nine percent interest because we have "their" money. When they realise I don't _have_ an income on account of them suspending, they'll get a court order to allow them to 'recover' the money by seizure of assets. Court costs will be added to the 'debt'."

"That's extortion!"

"A demand for money against a threat of harm? Yes, that's exactly what it is. Well spotted."

"Why do people put up with this shit?"

"First of all, provided they aren't the victim, most people take the attitude that it's the government's right and responsibility to make rules in the public interest, and our responsibility to comply with them."

"By what right do these people decide for me?"

"Democracy, right? By the people for the people."

"Are you serious?"

"No, just messing with you. I'm not sure true democracy has ever existed. The ancient Greeks came up with sortition, but I'm not sure it was ever actually implemented."

"Sortition?"

"Ballot selection. Like jury duty, but for members of parliament. The problem with elections is you get politicians. Elections give you people who _want_ to govern, and people who can afford to run an election campaign, which is rich people and sock puppets for interest groups like political parties and corporations. Even the ancient Greeks figured out that these are exactly the wrong people to be in charge.

"At any rate, we are playing a game in which our opponent is also the referee."

"Well," she said, "then the answer is obvious. The only way to win the game is not to play it."

"I'm not sure that's an option they're offering."

"That just tells me you're still playing their game."

"Let's project this forward, like the not-paying thing. You want us completely outside the system, right? It's not like going camping, there's no going home with a big hamper of dirty laundry four days later. We sod off to god-knows-where and then we need food production, food storage, water collection, water treatment, grey water disposal, black water disposal, shelter, heating, lighting, textiles and that's just to live. Do you _really_ think these arseholes would leave us be? They own _everything_ because they said so. So they will send thugs to take our stuff and chase us off 'their' land and afterwards they'll send us a bill for putting them to the inconvenience."

She stared at him. She had _that_ look in her eyes. The one that was always a lot of work. She didn't say anything, she pulled up the mesh on her augs and started doing research. Two days later she came to him and said "Give 'em their blood money." Then she gave him their phones. "Put us on the minimum plans." When he'd done it, she switched off the phones and threw them in the garbage. "Keep paying them. We need the element of surprise.

The days weren't so long when she started clocking off at five. She knew it wouldn't last, but didn't care. It wouldn't matter when the house sold. When they fired her it would free up the time she normally wasted on traffic or being at the office. Then it finally happened, with a nice surprise: fuel is expensive, so not commuting saves a motza. Also, no takeaway coffee, no bought lunch. 

She began to see the bigger picture. Everything they relied on &mdash; electricity, clean water, tools, even basic materials like nails or fabric &mdash; was part of a vast, interconnected system. Breaking away from it meant either replicating it on a smaller scale or learning to live without. Neither option was simple.

The first step, she realised, was relocation. Remoteness was key. They needed to move to a place where surveillance and enforcement would be expensive and logistically difficult. Somewhere far from urban centers, where the terrain itself could act as a barrier. The goal wasn’t to disappear entirely but to make it costly for the state to monitor or interfere with them. Distance would buy them time and space to build their systems without constant oversight.

Relocation wouldn’t be easy, but it didn't have to be everyone at once. They’d need to carefully plan the move, ensuring they could transport essential supplies, tools, and knowledge, progressively constructing the pillars of a micro-civilisation. They needed locations with specific constellations of natural resources: water, arable land, timber and so forth. Remoteness would make trade and communication harder, but this was a feature, not a bug. They couldn’t depend on external systems that could be monitored, controlled, or disrupted. Instead, they needed to focus on complete self-sufficiency.

For trade, they’d eliminate dependence by producing everything they needed within their community. Food, clothing, tools, and even basic medicines would need to be locally sourced or manufactured. This meant prioritizing skills like weaving, blacksmithing, and herbal medicine. For communication, they’d avoid external channels altogether. Decisions would be made locally. Coordination between communities doesn't require communication when the things that need coordinating are seasonal.

Finally, they’d need to focus on resilience rather than escape. Even in a remote location, they had to make their communities difficult to dismantle. Knowledge and skills had to be distributed among many people, so no single loss could cripple them. Supplies and tools had to be hidden or disguised, ensuring they couldn’t be easily confiscated. And most importantly, they needed to cultivate strong relationships within their communities. Trust and cooperation would be their greatest defense.

As she refined her plans, it struck her: what she was building was, in essence, a secular version of an Amish community, but with the advantage of starting from a higher level of technology. Like the Amish, they would prioritise self-sufficiency, community cohesion, and independence from centralised systems. But unlike the Amish, they wouldn’t reject technology outright &mdash; they would use it strategically, adopting only what they could sustain and repair themselves.

This realisation gave her a sense of clarity. The goal wasn’t to recreate the modern world on a smaller scale &mdash; it was to build something fundamentally different. A system where technology served the community, not the other way around. Where people worked together to meet their needs, rather than competing for resources controlled by distant powers. It wasn’t about going backward; it was about moving forward in a way that made sense.

She wrote this down too, adding it to her growing list of principles. The community would embrace technology, but only as a tool, never as a crutch. They would teach their children not just how to use it, but how to understand and maintain it. And they would always ask: does this serve us, or does it make us serve it?

Then he made one of those learned pronouncements of his, which were always pompous and sometimes profound: "The problem isn't community, it's centralisation. The more you concentrate power or resources, the more worthwhile it is for someone to do the wrong thing. It's a prize for cheating. At the scale of a village, you can't _do_ that because everyone knows everyone's business."

She thought about this deeply. Centralisation was a seductive trap. It _did_ create efficiencies, especially in the beginning, but it created systems where power and resources were hoarded, making exploitation inevitable. The solution wasn’t isolation but decentralization: smaller, self-sufficient communities where accountability was built into the structure.

Her solution was radical but simple: build a network of like-minded people. Each person or family would contribute their expertise &mdash; farming, carpentry, mechanics, medicine &mdash; and together they could create a self-sustaining community. It wouldn’t be easy, but it was the only way to avoid the pitfalls of isolation and the vulnerabilities of centralisation.

She started drafting a plan. First, they’d need to identify others who shared their vision. Then, they’d pool resources to acquire land far enough from prying eyes but close enough to trade routes for essentials they couldn’t produce. They’d need to prioritise skills training, ensuring everyone could contribute and adapt. And most importantly, they’d need to document everything &mdash; how to grow food, repair tools, purify water &mdash; so future generations wouldn’t face the same gaps in knowledge.

It was daunting, but it was also exhilarating. For the first time, she felt like they weren’t just reacting to the world’s problems &mdash; they were building something better.

Her notes grew and grew, a plan slowly taking shape. She knew he was right, two people can't run a civilisation. There's just too much to do.

Even just milk. Grass in one end of a cow, milk out the other. But things are never that simple. The cow has to be pregnant to lactate. Get all the figures, do all the math, and it turns out that for a steady supply of milk you need two cows, a bull and something to do with a steady stream of calves. And you get ten litres a day. Who the hell wants ten litres of milk every day?

There were many things like that, which she summed up with an epigraph:

> No man is an island, entire unto himself.

It became obvious that you had to have a community so people can specialise: someone with a dairy herd, a carpenter, a plumber, a blacksmith, a weaver, a tailor. She wondered about this. It felt like doom: the beginning of the very thing she wanted to flee. Then he made one of those learned pronouncements of his, which were always pompous and sometimes profound: "The problem isn't community, it's centralisation. The more you concentrate power or resources, the more worthwhile it is for someone to do the wrong thing. It's a prize for cheating. At the scale of a village, you can't _do_ that because everyone knows everyone's business."

She did more research. Millers were the beginning of capitalism. Owning the local mill let you skim the farmers, and you ended up wealthier than them. She invented communism: the people should own the means of production. The problem with that was the tragedy of the commons, which is a fancy way to say that it's not just rich people who try to socialise costs and privatise profits.

The trick, she decided, is that the users should also be the maintainers. Like a little council, except if you want to spend group money you have to get people to chip in first, and they can say no. Or they can't, if it's genuinely necessary and they want their grain milled. The ratepayers _are_ the councillors and they actually know what's important for doing the job.

She kept digging and thinking and scheming. It takes, she read, a village to raise a child. In her mind a brave new world began to coalesce. They weren't starting from nothing in medi&aelig;val Europe. Everyone would be literate and numerate, and there's no reason they couldn't teach those things to children while teaching them the family trade.

Some things were going to be harder. Poly-pipe depends on petrochemical industry, which simply isn't something you can do at village scale. With a bit of ingenuity you might be able to recycle all that waste plastic, but that's just Roman Pot Syndrome waiting to happen.

"What," he said, "is Roman Pot Syndrome?"

She told him she looked at the fall of the Roman Empire to learn from the experience of communities breaking away from the pervasive authority of that time. One of the things she noticed was that as the Empire shrank there was high quality pottery everywhere for the taking, so nobody bothered to learn how to make it. Then one day there wasn't, and nobody knew.

"We," she said, "are going to have this problem. Not us personally, but our descendants. We can take supplies of poly-pipe and tools with us but what do we do when they run out? Do you know how to _make_ a screwdriver? How about more screws?"

As it happened he _did_ know how to turn a thread, but that required a lathe, and only moved the problem to billet steel. And without welding rods and electricity his arc welder was useless. He certainly didn't know how to make replacement cutting and grinding discs.

He joined in her planning some evenings. It was fascinating; she was planning a mission to colonise another planet, without the other planet.

"You know it doesn't matter how careful you are, eventually they will notice you, and then you will be seen as a threat."

"We won't be a threat, they can stew in their own juice. I can't think of a more just fate."

"You _will_ be a threat. The last thing a government wants is people realising they can say no. So they will make an example of you."

It was a certainty: they would be seen as a threat. The state would escalate &mdash; seizing land, freezing assets, or even criminalizing their way of life outright. They would be painted as dangerous, selfish, or even criminal to justify the crackdown.

She started thinking about how to counter this. At first, she decided, they would try for invisibility. They couldn’t openly declare independence; they had to blend in, appear compliant while quietly building their network. No grand statements, no public defiance &mdash; just quiet, methodical preparation.

They’d need to decentralise their assets. Land and resources couldn’t all be in one place or under one name. They’d need trusted allies to hold pieces of the puzzle, so no single raid or seizure could destroy everything. Second, they’d need redundancy. If one farm was shut down, others would pick up the slack. Third, they’d need to stay small and local. Large, visible operations would attract attention, but small, scattered communities could fly under the radar.

A thought surfaced from her days as a paralegal: they should be legally independent holders of first mortgage on each other's properties. Privileges intended to serve the greed of bankers could be used to thwart seizure of property. And they couldn't change the law, the bankers would go nuts.

When invisibility inevitably failed, she devised a fallback plan: feed the state false intelligence. The goal was to make the community appear as though it was slowly failing, not worth the effort of further scrutiny. They would carefully craft a narrative of internal struggles, dwindling resources, and disillusioned members leaving. 

This would require subtlety. They couldn’t overplay their hand or make the community seem like an immediate threat. Instead, they would leak just enough information to suggest that their experiment was collapsing under its own weight. Fake disputes over leadership, staged shortages of food or supplies, and even fabricated departures of key members could all be part of the ruse.

The key was to control the flow of information. They would use trusted intermediaries to "accidentally" let details slip, ensuring the state believed it was uncovering the truth on its own. Meanwhile, the community would continue to thrive in secret, using the false narrative as a shield against further interference.

She reasoned that this strategy wasn’t truly risky because the state would likely escalate its actions regardless of what the community did. Feeding false intelligence wouldn’t increase the threat level; it would simply redirect the state’s focus and buy the community more time. The state’s aggression was inevitable, but this approach could delay it and reduce its intensity by making the community seem unworthy of the effort.

They also knew that eventually, the state would send police. The community had prepared for this inevitability, understanding that the police would likely blunder in with inadequate numbers, relying on the assumption that people would fold immediately. The single road into the valley was both a vulnerability and an opportunity. It was the only access point, and because it ran along the valley floor, phones and radios couldn’t reach the outside world. However, radios worked perfectly well within the valley, and the locals used them for communication.

Their plan was simple but effective. First, they would monitor the road for any incoming vehicles. Spotters stationed at high points along the valley would use radios to alert the community of approaching police. This early warning system would give them time to prepare.

The road itself was fitted with sump-busters, hinged rows of heavy spikes. Like a hinged section of picket fence, normally they lie flush with the road. Hinged into the raised position by a heavy chain in the pit below, they stop vehicles like a pikeman stopping a cavalry horse.

The police would drive over them, unhindered and blissfully unaware, their retreat quietly cut off. Eventually they would find the road closed in front of them. It would shock them to discover they weren't in control of the situation, and it would _really_ rattle them to find out they were isolated, unable to call for reinforcements.

The goal wasn’t to harm the police but to force a negotiation. The community would use the situation to demonstrate their preparedness and resolve, making it clear that any further attempts to interfere would be costly and futile. They would offer the officers safe passage out of the valley in exchange for leaving them alone.

The state would escalate. If they were smart, the next thing they sent would be an excavator to dig out the sump-buster. She couldn't think of a proportionate response that would work. Mining the road would work, but they needed to be the good guys when it hit the media.

You could make the sumpbuster so deeply anchored that it would take more than one day to dig out. They'd leave the digger overnight and you could put egg-white in the fuel, disabling it. Or even confiscate it, diggers are expensive and useful. But what if they were smart enough not to leave the digger untended?

Drones, she decided. With a paint spray gun. If you can't see you can't dig. The escalation from there would probably be an escort trying to shoot down the drones. Paintguns from a distance? 
a wicked fancy took her and she giggled, imagining the psychological warfare tactic of playing duelling banjos.
