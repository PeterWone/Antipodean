Shorty looked irate. Watching the outside news would do that to a man, he thought. Snorting, he wondered why it had taken living here for two years to see through the charades.

He muttered under his breath: "Clue time for politicians: you are public servants, not public masters. We tell you what to think, not the other way around, and if you don't like it then your choices are suck it up, step down or admit you are a despot."

Sheila stood in the doorway, looking at him with an appraising face.

"You sound like Forest."

He blinked at her. "Then he's right. But it's just common sense. I don't know why I ever thought we lived in a democracy. Have any of them ever asked what _you_ wanted them to do?"

She laughed.

He went on. "It occurred to me the other day that no-one I ever voted for ended up winning. I never realised it before, but at no point in my entire life have I ever had representation. How did I manage to live for forty years without noticing that?"

Sheila had an odd expression, like she'd reached a decision or something. She didn't say what, just walked up and embraced him.

"Aiden likes it here."

"Yeah, he's found some friends. Bazza's kid, what was his name?"

"Scott. They're always off running around together. Nothing's ever a walk, always full tilt."

"Oh to be young again. Wish I'd grown up in a place like this. You ever hear Forest talk about the things he got up to as a kid? It's like a different planet."

"You know his childhood was fifty years ago and on farms and the outskirts of country towns, right?"

"Yeah I guess. But in some ways he's recreated it here for the kids. Ken was telling me his lad was wandering with friends and Forest steered them away from the Antithesis compound. For a consolation prize he took them to pull frames out of one of his supers."

"Pull what out of what?"

"Beehives. Honeycomb."

"Is _that_ where it came from? There's some in the kitchen! It's in one of those weird flat stoneware containers the hippie makes."

"Hippie?"

"The pig-lady with the young trees."

"Those pigs scare me. Have you seen the size of those sows?"

Ken "Doll" Murchison sat on the couch in the prefab double-donger he shared with his wife and son Scott, listening with one annoyed ear to a televised tale of political misconduct. The reporter probably didn't see it that way; she was all but fan-girling the Prime Minister, who was busy remonstrating the nation for not buying into the inherent special-ness and privilege his government accorded the 'First Nations'.

"For starters," said Ken to his TV, "they weren't first. They were the second wave."

On the screen the PM went on as though he hadn't heard.

"Second, they weren't a bloody nation. They were two or three hundred separate tribes. With a hundred distinct languages, no central government and no organised opposition when our lot turned up. Not. A. Nation."

The Prime Minister didn't care. He knew what was best, and the media would play it over and over until the voters forgot there was another point of view. Ken grabbed the remote and angrily switched it off. Watching made his blood boil, but if you didn't watch then you didn't even know what they were up to.

Outside with a beer he calmed, halfway through capping it and putting it back in the fridge so the kids or worse the missus didn't come home and see him drinking alone. Only on exercise did he ever really feel like he belongs. Him and the boys, discipline and hot brass against the slavering horde. He could _shoot_ the plant monsters. Sometimes while he did it he fantasised about hosing down the parliament, washing away the smug lying thieves with blood and brass.

His boy came home, skinned knees and shorts, picking a tick off one arm and flicking it away, all gruesome grin and missing teeth and cheerful freedom from responsibility. 

Ken looked at his watch.

"It does _not_ take 45 minutes to get here from the school. Where've you been?"

"Miss Carter took us up the the fish nursery, they're spawning at last! Aiden's dad said that means Forest will stock the dams and next year we can go fishing. You always say how great the fishing was when you were a kid. I want to try that."

"I don't mean to rain on your parade, son, but it takes more than one year for the fish to grow. And that's if nothing goes wrong."

His father's voice was softer than usual, full of regret and the certain knowledge that the world would fail him again. There was no hope in it and the boy's face fell. An angry man with no hope and no place in the world realised his boy needed him. Wanted him.

"We won't be fishing for a while yet, but did you know the crawchies grow a lot faster than the fish? Forest put em in last year when they built the low dam. I actually do fancy our chances of a boil up. Want to go see whether we can surprise mum with a seafood dinner?"

A crotchety old Slav with aching joints and a burden of memories no cultured person should be expected to bear was having a nice day. The kids who walked across his land without asking were well-mannered and apologetic. They probably _hadn't_ known where the unfenced boundary was. He took them down the bottom where his rifle and ammo boxed were laid out across a table made from an old solid-timber door, and showed them that they'd walked right across between him and his targets. Not only did they look suitably shaken, they recovered, took responsibility, said they'd warn their friends to stay away from there, and then made his day by asking whether he would teach them.

"One question, sir," said one of them, a boy named Aiden. "Rifles are _loud_. My dad says TV silencers are bullshit, real ones should be called mufflers not silencers. Why couldn't we hear you?"

The old face creased in a smile, it was an outstanding question. 

"This and five more like it." He leaned in conspiratorially and picked up an odd device that looked like a chunky old radio. "Space magic. Gift from Autumn!"

"Why? Is it a secret?"

"Partly, young one. But some of my tools are _very_ loud." He flicked a catch on a big oiled timber case with brass fittings, lifting it open to reveal the oily gleam of a well cared for SPNKr. The boys drew in their breath as one.

"Stand there. I show." He pointed. Putting on earmuffs and switching off the alien space magic, he looked back. "Open mouth. Put finger in ears, both. Is _loud_." He waited for compliance and seated his earmuffs, checked the boys again then fired. Almost a second later the round hit and all of them jumped. He didn't need to see to know. Making the weapon safe he unloaded and set it down.

"Alien space magic." He flicked it back on. "No need to upset ladies."

Scott and Aiden stared with stars in their eyes at the place where the target used to be.

// todo Janna doing horticulture, ducks and piglets as children magnet. Bees talk to Janna, she never mentioned it because crazy. Paint her like a proper old school witch (herbalist and horticulturalist). Autumn is having fun metaphorically dressing up the humans like dolls hence the soap-making cauldron (not yet given) and she has cast Janna as the mother (maiden, mother, crone). From Janna's point of view this has benefits, not least of which is the bees make sure she is the first to know any change in the weather and when any plant shows the slightest sign of wilting (time to water). To others she has an unearthly grip on the world about her. Her already significant knowledge of the uses of herbs and the preparation of tinctures and remedies from them is now supported via advice from Autumn through the bees; thus she appears to have the entirety of human wisdom on the subject (and effectively does)

// todo Forest building a communal ablutions block, showers, toilets, washing machines, wide verandas with shutters, with an open fireplace in the shower. Because he hates cold bathrooms. It also has a boiler for hot water. Invite ground team for pig on a spit and try out the sauna (not all at once it's not that big).

---

// todo Trixie making Forest fence her kitchen garden to keep wallabies out. Fores is lazy, his solution is to teach kids bowhunting and point out to them that herb gardens are prey magnets. Mid-October they discover the fireflies. Learning how to keep leeches off while lying in wait.

//todo Forest looking astonished that anyone thinks well of him

"You cannot be serious. I'm lazy. Thoughtless. Self-centred. Vain. I 'spose I'm not greedy. Apart from food. I don't handle criticism well. Even when I do things for others it's only because I need them to look after me too. I'm pretty sure the only reason I'm honest is I'm so bad at telling lies it's safer."

This is belied by his actual conduct and the gentle mercy he shows for animals that need his help. Which may be the final mercy, but this is not a casual decision.

He worries about the verified fact that his once astonishingly sharp (but lazy) mind is not what it was. Memory fails, and reasoning is following it, though fortunately not quickly. He likes being put on a pedestal but worries he might fail people, and not deserve it. Ironically, the harder he tries to live up to his own legend the bigger it gets.

There is a terrible inner conflict because Autumn has offered him implants to help with his failing brain but Trixie is dead against that kind of tech and he doesn't want to lie about it to her, especially because there is a possibility it could fail and widow her.
