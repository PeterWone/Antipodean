Sophia sat at her desk, reclining in her boss chair with an assessing expression, peering at Eric from half-lowered, almost hooded eyes.

"Another transfer request. I thought they liked it here. I know the man. He seemed more than happy."

"It, ah, his wife thought of it. It's a secondment, not a permanent transfer."

She sat up.

"OK, Eric, I know you aren't stupid and you don't seem concerned. So what exactly are they up to?"

He looked nervously around the room, eyes falling on various places she knew he regularly swept for listening devices.

Dots connected like falling dominoes in her devious mind and her mouth twitched toward a smile. She let him suffer for a few more seconds, then chuckled.

"Oh thee of little faith. For the record, Autumn tells me you found all but two and she suborned those."

"Why didn't you tell me!?"

She tilted her head, giving him time to catch up.

"Oh, of course. If I found _all_ of them it would be noticed. Most but not all, they think they've got you."

"Autumn, would you mind giving him a quick demo. As a transcript on his augs, so he can see what you're doing. Tell me when to start."

> _Start now._

"What they hear isn't always what I say. For example, I am a naughty girl who's planning to take over the government."

In real time &mdash; literally as she spoke &mdash; text flowed on Eric's augs.


```
I'm sure they hear every word I say. It doesn't matter, I am a naughty girl but only with the outfits I've been buying.
```

"Fine," said Eric. "It just makes me nervous. I missed some. How do you know Autumn got everything?"

> _There's a reason the kids like saying "Not a leaf shall fall". I've co-opted every last transmission capable device in the valley as a security measure. Don't let that stop you from doing your job. If I ever have intel I can't figure out, I will certainly share it with you; there's a non-zero chance you'll have the one extra fact we need. I haven't mentioned it till now because I didn't want to reduce your diligence. Or make you feel superfluous. Outclassed in some ways, but you are not irrelevant. Apart from anything else you have a better feel for how our friends at the signals directorate will think._

"Silly question, why haven't you suborned the directorate computers?"

> _They're surprisingly competent, if a little stone-age. Everything is air-gapped. Even the voice calls are converted to analogue, band-pass filtered to human hearing frequencies and brought in via speaker and microphone; literally air-gapped. And I see where you got your professional paranoia: They reboot it daily from a read-only volume._

"Fine, but paranoia is my duty. Boss, let's get some coffee and talk a walk."

Outside was crisp in the early August afternoon. They stopped in the cloak-room where Sophia put her armour on and Eric collected his gun-belt.

"It's so different. Four years in and it's still weird everyone being armed."

"What's weird is kids learning heavy weapons handling from their fathers while the mothers' club watches. And have you seen how people react to bees these days?"

"Talking to them like they seriously expect to be heard and understood?"

> _It's not an unreasonable expectation._

"What's interesting is how safe bees make people feel, even when most of them are the honey-producing kind."

They strolled along the road for a hundred metres, then clambered up the pine side embankment to a pig-trail. 

"Come on then, loyal but paranoid minion. Spill the beans. Why are so many people who love it here, people whose children are _not_ going to like the city, moving back there? One or to with dying parents, sure. But what's with the exodus? Alright, half a dozen isn't quite an exodus, but in the same month? I won't be the only one to notice, either."

Eric paused, one foot on a storm-fall tree.

"I imagine you've had Forest's speech about the difference between self-reliance and self-sufficiency?"

"Four times now. It worries him."

"He's not the only one. I mentioned it came from his missus, right? So the kids worship Forest and Oleksiy, with the ground team not far behind. They get in their mothers' ears about it, and you ought to know better than most that men rule but women decide."

"Don't let Forest hear you use that word!" Mischief danced in her eyes.

"Righto smarty. Point is that the kids convinced the girls and they thought about it with adult brains and university educations. It isn't Forest the state ought to worry about, it's the valley mothers club. There's thirty of 'em, at least half are well educated. The other half aren't stupid, and all of 'em like it here. They like how their kids are, even if it's sometimes a bit weird when they do things like black-ban flour."

"And the fact that they like it here causes them to leave, how?"

"It's complicated."

"Make it simple."

"OK, they're recruiting."

"What's complicated about that?"

"They can't just place a job ad. Didn't I just explain they're well educated with plenty of time to think? They know how important it is the state not realise what's happening here. They _know_ this is a kind of rebellion. Not just breaking a law, actively seeking to subvert the system with a long term view to bringing down a state before it recognises them as a threat."

"_That_ is what they talk about at the range meets? That's not what I've heard there, and I'm not _always_ with the students."

"Not all the time. Sometimes they talk about gardens, or kids, or whose husband's hurt, or his... recovered enthusiasm." 

Sophia giggled, remembering when the Shorty tale did the rounds, mostly spread by his very satisfied wife.

"But sometimes they plan global politics? Don't they know that's done by old men in smoky rooms?"

"The old men may be in for a shock."

"So tell me about this secret rebellion recruitment drive. What exactly is the mothers' club plan for world domination?"

"Well, basically they've decided that Forest is an eccentric genius who doesn't finish projects&mdash;"

"Accurate."

" &mdash;who accidentally built a slice of heaven, and they're going to bake the whole pie."

"Bake the whole pie."

"Remember when he fretted for days about how to make screws."

"Yep?"

"It's piecemeal. He won't live long enough to finish, and we can't wait. But they understood what he was worried about. They made a list. Then they split into teams and drew an org charts and more lists. And got back together and compared lists, had a huuuuuge argument and eventually created a project plan. From which there were more lists, apparently with a dependency chain. Through all this they had a lovely time asking Forest exactly the sort of questions he frets about."

"Are you telling me the mothers' club has a comprehensive plan to save civilisation?"

"Yes. No. Sort of. They had the start of one. Except strictly speaking they're trying to _prevent_ civilisation. That word means "formation of cities" and what we have here is society _without_ centralisation. It's the exact _opposite_ of civilisaton. At any rate, Autumn joined in and made Forest buy documents from the Reboot catalogue and hand them out."

"Made him. That I wish I'd seen. I didn't think anyone but Trixie could _make_ Forest do anything."

"They do have an interesting relationship, that's certainly true. Anyway, apparently we aren't the first people to go through this and there are _manuals_ for where to start and the order to do things. So they've been busy reading and thinking some more."

"I do _not_ believe that Autumn was unaware of what they were up to. I wonder why she didn't lead with that."

> _They weren't ready. And then they were._

Autumn's cheeky voice crackled out of Eric's radio.

"And these manuals tell you to recruit?"

"No, they tell you what you have to do. The ladies identified skill gaps, and decided to fill them. By recruiting. It's quite interesting, there are things you have to do that you don't even need. You do them to preserve skills."

"This would be Forest's Roman Pot Syndrome?"

"The remedy, yes."
