Eloise leaned back against the wall of the caf, rubbing her eyes, then her whole head because it felt like it would burst. She was skimming through the reboot guide. One of a dozen volumes, supported by hundreds and hundreds of textbooks. 

The pages swam before her eyes, dense with diagrams and formulas that should have made sense but somehow didn't quite connect. She'd been at it for three hours straight, and her brain felt like overcooked porridge.

Sheila brought her more coffee and a wrap. They still hadn't got flour right but unleavened bread seemed to work.

"You're pushing too hard," Sheila said quietly, settling the plate down. "When did you last take a proper break?"

Eloise couldn't remember. She leaned forward, head in her hands and muttered out through her fingers.

"I have a fucking degree, you know. A bach of mech eng. It wasn't just a bit of paper either, I designed shop floor automation and it bloody well worked. Actual factories making actual things that people bought and used."

"Yes? That's why you read this stuff so much faster than the rest of us. You don't know how grateful we are to have you explaining it to us."

"I feel like a goddamn child. There's so _much_." Eloise gestured helplessly at the stack of volumes. "Yesterday I was trying to understand the metallurgy chapter and it referenced seventeen different alloy compositions, each with their own heat treatment protocols, and every single one depends on precise atmospheric controls during forging that we can't maintain without..." She made a frustrated noise. "Without industrial infrastructure we don't have and can't build because we don't have the tools to make the tools to make the tools."

> _You are trying to stuff the entire know-how of a technological civilisation into one head, Eloise. You aren't just standing on the shoulders of giants, you're trying to be all the giants at once. That you aren't failing miserably is an extraordinary display of intellectual prowess._

"Can you do it?"

> _...Yes. But I am bringing to bear considerably greater computational and storage resources than your entire civilisation. You're trying to do it with one organic brain._

Ellie decided to think about coffee instead of mortal limits. The bitter taste was familiar, grounding. She noticed several of the range mothers had drifted closer, listening intently to the exchange. Rebecca, Sarah, and Monica formed a loose semicircle around the table where the textbooks lay splayed open like accusatory evidence. Autumn turned over her presence drone, to face them.

> _Can I ask why you invited me?_

Rebecca spoke for the group, her usual directness cutting through any diplomatic hedging. "We're struggling. Time is of the essence. You could probably do something and you don't. No doubt there's some reason for that which we haven't figured out but to be honest some days I wonder what's the point when you can always do everything quicker and better. I kinda feel outclassed when Ellie looks at those hieroglyphics in the textbooks and just knows what it means... and she feels outclassed by you."

Sarah shifted her youngest to her other hip. "We've been at this for months now. Monica's getting ulcers from the stress, I'm not sleeping, and yesterday Rebecca threw a wrench at the wall when the water pump assembly refused to fit properly again."

"I missed," Rebecca said dryly. "Which pissed me off even more."

> _To be honest in return I don't really understand why you haven't asked for more help._

"We can't depend on anything we can't make, but even with it laid out for us in the books there's just so _much!_ We'll never get that many ducks lined up. And we can't ask _you_ for a space magic fix, that just _moves_ the dependency."

Monica spoke up from behind Sarah, voice quiet but carrying. "It's not even about pride anymore. Well, not just pride. If we can't understand it, can't maintain it, can't teach our kids how it works... what happens when you're not here?"

> _Your children depend on you. They will not always. Are you not proud of how they grow? Why should I think less of you, when every day you make me proud? You will find your own way. If you fall, I will see it. And then I will pick you up, dust you off and watch while you try again._

The silence stretched, heavy with something Eloise couldn't quite name. She saw Rebecca blink rapidly, and Sarah's grip tighten on her child. Even Monica's shoulders had relaxed slightly.

> _I do, however, have a question. You are right to reject things you can't make, but you could ask Forest to buy a Class II fabber and a blueprint for a Class II fabber. Then you'd be able to make more Class II fabbers and you'd be truly independent. You'd still have to set up to power them, but that's the sort of project that will have the boys happily building steam engines and armatures._

They stared at her, flabbergasted.

"A what now?" Sarah said faintly.

"Wait, back up," Rebecca managed. "You can make the machine that makes the machine?"

> _You don't have to use it for everything, you know. You can just buy blueprints to fill gaps for things that otherwise require a huge industrial pyramid, like silicone sealant for example._

The explosion was immediate and fierce.

"That's exactly what we're talking about!" Monica's voice cracked like a whip. "We'd have this magic box that just... makes things! Where's the learning in that? Where's the understanding?"

"But if we can make our own blueprints—" Sarah started.

"Can we, though?" Rebecca cut in. "Really? Or would we just be playing with alien toys, pretending we understand them?"

"It's not pretending if it works," Eloise said, surprising herself by jumping into the fray. "When I designed automation systems, I didn't reinvent the electric motor. I used motors that existed and built something new with them."

"That's different," Monica shot back. "You understood motors. You could fix them, improve them, teach someone else how they worked."

"Could I, though?" Eloise found herself leaning forward, energized by the argument. "I mean, I understood the principles, sure. But could I have wound copper wire and laminated steel cores from scratch? Made the magnets? The controller chips?"

Rebecca was shaking her head. "This is exactly the problem. Where does it end? Do we need to mine our own copper? Smelt our own steel? At what point are we allowed to use something we didn't build from first principles?"

> _The same point your children are allowed to use language they didn't invent,_ Autumn said gently. _The same point they're allowed to benefit from your love without having earned it._

"That's not the same thing," Sarah protested, but her voice lacked conviction.

> _Isn't it? Every tool you use, every technique you learn, builds on the work of others. The question isn't whether you made it yourself. The question is whether you understand it well enough to use it wisely, maintain it properly, and teach others to do the same._

Monica was quiet for a long moment, then: "But what if we get dependent on it? What if we stop trying to figure things out for ourselves?"

"Then you'd become lazy and useless," Rebecca said bluntly. "Which you won't, because that's not who any of you are. Hell, Monica, you spent six weeks trying to get that water pump working instead of asking for help. You think you'd suddenly turn into couch potatoes because we had better tools?"

Eloise was thinking furiously, her engineer's mind finally clicking into gear. "Could we create our own blueprints? How does that work? Is it like when I would design machinery and produce 3D models and print them? The first one was slow but then we'd use it to make moulds and set up for production runs?"

> _You could use it like that I suppose. The kind of blueprints normally used are for complete, assembled complex machinery, but you could use it as a big 3D printer I suppose._

"So we could design our own improvements," Eloise continued, warming to the idea. "Take existing blueprints and modify them. Learn by doing, but with better tools."

"Wait," Rebecca interrupted, her practical mind catching up. "What does it use for materials? I mean, you can't just magic iridium out of thin air, right? If I want to make iridium spark plugs, I still need actual iridium to feed into this thing?"

> _Of course. It's not a replicator from a science fiction show. You need to provide all the raw materials. It's more like a very, very precise automated workshop than actual magic._

"Right," Eloise said, nodding. "So we'd still need to source materials, understand what we're working with, plan our projects around what we can actually get."

"That's... actually better," Monica said slowly. "We'd still have to understand material properties, still have to think about supply chains and substitutions."

"And recycling," Sarah added. "We'd probably get really good at breaking down old machinery to recover rare elements."

Sarah looked thoughtful. "Like... we could start with simple things? Things we already understand?"

"And work our way up," Monica said slowly. "Use it to make the precise parts we can't forge by hand, but still understand every component."

Rebecca was nodding. "It's not replacing our brains. It's replacing our hammers and lathes."

"Better hammers and lathes," Eloise corrected. "Much better."

> _The choice is yours,_ Autumn said. _But remember — your children will inherit whatever decision you make. Do you want them to inherit your struggles, or your wisdom?_

They argued for hours, but it was happier and it went somewhere. Eventually they asked Autumn not to suggest the Class II fabber idea to Forest unless things were dire. Eloise looked more than a little disappointed. She was warming to the idea of engineering with a literally out-of-this-world 3D printer.

Then someone asked Autumn whether there was anyone they could talk to with experience of using this sort of gear. The answer was, surprisingly, 'Forest'.

"Yeah, Dusty had one of them," Forest said when they eventually found him and brought up the subject. "They're not much use for fancy stuff unless it's busted and you want another one the same, otherwise you're on a bit of a quest for rare stuff."

"Were you planning to _mention_ this at any point?"

"Yep."

"_When?_"

"'Bout ten minutes after you ran out of ideas. You're doing a way better job of this than I was. Far be it for me to rain on your parade, or break the creative flow."

"God, you are such a _shit!_"

"Yeah Trixie says that."

"Fix the flour thing. Or I will send an army of pie-deprived children to pester you."

"Talk to Autumn. Flour is mostly simple carbohydrates. A Class II fabber should be able to make flour from leaf litter." He left.

After a lengthy, non-plussed paused, she said "Could it?"

> _Yes. In the same way that Leonardo da Vinci could paint walls: slowly, inefficiently and expensively, with a waste of talent verging on the criminal._
