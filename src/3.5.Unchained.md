Sophia’s fingers stung. The E string snapped with a sharp twang, curling back on itself like a question mark. She stared at the guitar, frustration rising.

Forest appeared in the doorway, a mug in one hand, a battered toolkit in the other. "Strings break," he said, matter-of-fact.

He knelt beside her, deftly unwinding the broken string and threading a new one from a packet that looked older than she was. "Ever restring a guitar?”

She shook her head. "I only ever played piano. At school."

He grinned. "Pianos are honest. Guitar is for cheaters like me." He showed her how to wind the string, how to tune by ear. She learned things about tuning she was sure weren't in the lessons at school. 

"There’s more than one way to tune a guitar," Forest said, testing the new string. "Back in the day, they used all sorts — Pythagorean, meantone, well temperament. Each had its own sound, suited to the music of its time. These days, we use equal temperament. It's more versatile, it makes it easier to play in any key, but you lose some of the old colour."

He glanced at the ceiling. "Autumn, could you play something in each of the tunings? Something well-known, written for each."

> _In Pythagorean tuning, we have "Salve Regina," a Gregorian chant._

The opening phrase rang with ancient clarity, pure and stark.

> _In mean-tone, John Dowland's "Lachrimae" for lute._

The chords were sweet and almost fragile, harmonies glowing in a way Sophia had never heard before.

"I feel like I know that."

> _You probably heard it like this._ 

Autumn played it in equal temperament. It sounded at once familiar and bland, like elevator music.

> _This piece even says in the name that it was written for a different tuning: Bach’s "Prelude in C Major" from the Well-Tempered Clavier. Listen carefully, Sophia: each key change subtly shifts the mood. If you ask me, this piece shimmers with tonal colour. It's a reason to rescue humanity in its own right._

It played for long minutes, an elegant piece from a more civilised age.

> _And here's "Let It Be" by The Beatles, written for equal temperament, smooth and even, every key as comfortable as the last.

Familiar voices crooned and faded out. Sophia nodded, absorbing the idea that even tuning was a choice, not a rule. "Why did they change?"

"Music changed. People wanted sweeter chords, more keys, more freedom. Every system is a compromise. You pick the one that fits what you want to play."

"Wanted more _keys?_"

> _Old tunings made some keys sound great and others awful. You could say that equal temperament was a compatibility patch._

"Oh." Sophia laughed. "I thought you meant on the keyboard."

Later, when the amp started to crackle, Forest produced a soldering iron and a handful of mismatched switches. "My first guitar was a knock-off Strat like this," he said, pulling off the knobs and unscrewing the scratch-plate. "Cost me a hundred bucks because it was busted. All I had to do was replace the switch and re-do the soldering." He soldered in silence, the smell of flux and burnt dust filling the air.

When he finished, he slung the guitar over his shoulder and played a few bars. The melody was almost familiar — something she’d heard in a dream, or maybe on a long drive at dusk. It was beautiful, at once familiar but not.

She watched his hands. "What's that called?"

He shook his head. "It doesn't have a name. It's just something I made up. B7, A7, E or E7. Technically it's a I IV V blues progression. I just play what feels right."

He started Hotel California, botched the transition from F to C, shrugged, and then, letting go of the effort, launched into a riff that was raw and perfect and utterly his.

Sophia smiled, feeling something inside her loosen. "You sound like a musician when you stop trying to do it by the book."

"There's probably a lesson in that."

She came back later that night, and every free night thereafter. The book sat on the shelf, gathering dust while she played until her fingers bled. Even the sour notes belonged. A melody that was wholly hers soared unfettered into the night. The next night she tried to play it again but what came out was new and richer, the grown-up child of yesterday's epiphany.

She told Forest, and he showed her an interview with Mark Knopfler, who never seemed to play the same song twice. "Sheet music", he said, "is for recitals. A recital is where someone else wrote the music and someone else tells you how it should sound. We don't do recitals, we play together. It's just the right word, 'play', because all our best work is us playing together, like children." The ancient maestro caressed the neck of a guitar and it sang a song about the world outside. "A long time ago, came a man on a track, walkin' forty miles with a sack on his back. He put down his load, where he thought it was the best, made a home in the wilderness." For a moment she was transfixed. It was like Knopfler had _been_ to the valley. The strumming stopped and the interview continued, but Forest stopped it. Just as well, what came next was not pretty. "Then came the doctors, then came the schools, then came the lawyers, then came the rules...six lanes of traffic, three lanes moving slow."

She wondered how she'd ever put up with a city. 

Or why _anyone_ would think they were a good idea.
