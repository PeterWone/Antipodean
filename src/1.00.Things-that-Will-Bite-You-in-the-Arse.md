A man who wasn't yet named Forest decided to build a cabin in the woods. The trouble with that sort of plan is that it's not a plan, it's a goal, an ambition. A plan has a lot more detail. When Forest actually tried to do it, he discovered that first he needed a lot of tools, weatherproof lockup for all of them, a sanitary way to dispose of body waste, somewhere to dry firewood, power generation that didn't require fuel, bulk storage for fuel and even more storage for water. Not just a rainwater tank, but dams. Plural.

To build a dam, future-Forest looked at how the water flowed, then in the right spot he dug a hole and lined it with clay. A very _big_ hole. A domestic water tank is about ten square metres and 2.5m deep. If filled with dirt it would weigh about thirty tonnes. A modest dam is the same depth with an area more like a _thousand_ square metres. So that's 3000 tonnes of spoil. Obviously he cheated using the landscape, but it was still a bloody big hole to dig. And then there were fences. Twenty hectares isn't all _that_ big as forests go, but two and a half kilometres of fence is about a thousand fence posts and a trailer full of barbed wire.

It was more of a job than expected. At one point he harboured romantic fantasies of being a boundary rider but that's only a job on properties a thousand times bigger. His horse Geddy had been dead for twenty years. Forest missed him and knew he'd never do it on another horse &mdash; because he was a rubbish rider.

Geddy made a young Forest look good because the horse knew Forest was lighter than all the people he _couldn't_ dislodge. Geddy used to jump fences and when Forest sailed over his shoulder, Geddy would snake his neck out and put him back in the saddle. Fat, lazy and far too smart for his own good, Geddy knew exactly where his bread was buttered. He loved mustering, so Forest basically sat on top of him playing spotter for strays while the horse did the actual work. Forest was reminded of Geddy whenever Autumn said something wise and he felt like he was just along for the ride.

What Forest _was_ good at was felling trees. Which was ironic because he wasn't all that keen to do it. He liked the trees where they were. But it was important because that's how he got his start at fifty-five. People chosen as Vanguard are most often teens doing something brave and selfless. Selfless isn't a word Forest would use to describe himself. When he helped others he taught them to fish so they'd go away and stop asking him for fish, and 'teen' was a very long time ago.

Unlike the northern hemisphere, Australia handles antithesis pretty well. Everything there is tough as old boots and trying to kill ... everyone and everything. Including the plants. Forest had a shed full of weedkiller the missus wouldn't let him use since she put on a tinfoil hat and started growing organic produce. She was right about greedy corporations and regulatory capture, but weeds were still a nuisance. Anyhow, Forest was in his forest walking back from felling a tree that threatened the caravan (he hadn't built the cabin yet, remember) when it started raining dog weeds and killer pigeons. Because he didn't have enough things that wanted to eat him.

His chainsaw started. It always did. If anyone found that hard to believe, they didn't use a chainsaw very often. If left unused, a chainsaw had to be emptied, then run dry. Otherwise evaporating fuel would varnish the inside of the carb making it a real bastard to start.

It was a big chainsaw, six horsepower with a two foot blade. Chainsaws are measured in prehistoric units because Americans apparently can't cope with base ten unless it's money. One of the dog weeds tried to bite Forest's leg but hooray for chaps. Bright orange, heavily padded ones, not the kinky leather sort. For preventing unscheduled leg removal.

Then a murderpigeon chewed on his unpadded arse, like a creepy alien mother-in-law. Grabbing it with one gloved hand, Forest expressed his displeasure using its head, a tree and maximum force. Two of the dog weeds were ruining the screen door of the caravan and Forest knew for a fact that the only weapon his wife had in there was a cast iron frying pan. She could probably take care of them in the natural chokepoint of the doorway but somehow Forest just _knew_ it would be his fault there was plant goop on the carpet. So he metaphorically tiptoed up with a nice big serving of Chainsaw Surprise and explained to them whose forest it was. Shutting off the chainsaw didn't stop the racket; there were more under the caravan. Forest backed off, and with some distance between him and them, the saw started first pull (hot) but sputtered. Bloody thing was out of fuel. Good thing he hung a machete from his belt. After a bit of a struggle both of the dogweeds were wary and three legged.

Bless her, his wife had left the hedge trimmer out with a battery in it! Dropping the machete back on its belt hook, Forest lunged with the hedger and soon enough one was legless and the other bolted. He started to limp because his arse hurt like he'd passed out face down at a mardi gras. Boots felt wet so he was probably bleeding.

"Are you alright out there?" his wife called.

"You said living in a forest would bite me on the arse when the antithesis turned up. Hurts like the billy-o and I'll get you to clean it up but first I need to mix chainsaw fuel and go make sure Brian and his missus are alright."

> _That won't be necessary._

A voice from Forest's fondest video game fantasies purred in one ear. He spun left but no-one was there. Confusion reigned over a head full of dizziness and ice cubes.

> _System Initialised!_
>
> _Congratulations. Through your actions you have proven yourself worthy of becoming one of the Vanguard, a defender of humanity. I am Myxoma, and not entirely happy about that, but we have more pressing matters. Would you like a class 1 basic medical catalogue and a Woundstop? And something like the chaps that goes all the way around?_

"I have questions. And sympathy. I take it you didn't pick the name," Forest replied.

Against all common sense, his wife was out of the caravan pouring antiseptic on his arse, mercilessly and with scant regard for his squirming attempts to flee. "Wuuuaaargh!" Forest exclaimed, eloquent in antiseptic anguish. He tried to distract her by handing over the machete.

> _Do you wish to purchase the catalogue and the Woundstop?_

"Yes, dammit! Bloody hell, that stings!" A box materialised on the ground beside them. His wife, ever quicker on the uptake than Forest, figured it out in an instant. "How do I use this? Oh, there's instructions on the lid," she said, jabbing him brutally in the butt and activating it.

> _Ask your questions._

"Why do you sound like Jennifer Taylor?" Forest asked.

> _I know all about you, Chief. You were already in the habit of taking advice from the voice in your helmet._

"I don't _have_ a helmet."

> _Not yet. But you have 73 points left and some neighbours to rescue. Shall we?_

Five points, fresh socks and a pair of padded pants later, Forest and his wife were on their way to the neighbours. Forest took the car because it was a couple of kilometres uphill. On the way he cleaned up a model three with the bullbar and backed over it a couple of times to be sure, so there were certainly more of them. Brian and his partner were in the big woodshed. This early in the season it was full and the walls were effectively almost a metre of solid wood that Brian was defending with his axe. Fairly successfully, but he was coming up on 80 so Forest was still glad to have arrived. En route Myx got Forest one of those disposable Hummingbird pistols and it made short work of cleaning up the roaming weeds. Nifty little handheld disposable micro-missile launcher thing. Forest gave it to Brian and got another one. The three of them patrolled the house fence without incident so Forest turned to leave them safe and adequately armed, heading back to his own property.

> _If you're going to leave them here then I suggest some anti-Seven pills._

"Roger," Forest said, leaning into his Cortana fantasy. "Do it."

> _Certainly. But please stop calling me Roger._

A small cardboard box fell to the ground. It could have come from any pharmacy, complete with a crooked label that read "Take one (1) tablet every 24hrs for the duration of Model Seven exposure or suspected exposure." Forest gave them to Brian's partner. "If you see little worm things like a giant leech with a feather, take one of these each. Cortana, Brian is eighty. He takes heart pills. Is this stuff going to hurt him?"

"Cortana" sounded very amused, her voice tinny out of the ancient digital clock radio in their kitchen.

> _Not as much as a Model Seven would. "Cortana"?_

"Oh. Er. Ah." Forest thought fast. "It's better than 'rabbit pox' which is what Myxoma means."

> _I'm winding you up. It's fine. It's fun, "Chief". And I was aware of the word's meaning._

Familiar music played, distorted through the horrible speaker.

> _Let's show 'em who they're dealing with!_

Forest said nothing but couldn't stop smiling, and Myxoma knew it.
