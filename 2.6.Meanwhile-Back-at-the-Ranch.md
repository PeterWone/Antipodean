Sophia cradled her head in her hands. She'd sent Eric up to the homestead to get the weapons from Trixie because he often did small jobs for her and was less likely to have trouble than her minions or &mdash; perish the thought &mdash; a corporate flunky.

With him went a handwritten note in Sophia's flowing cursive script, loosely folded and sealed. Very old-fashioned, the seal was her favourite of the few courtesies extended by Forest House.

The first surprise was a dinner invitation from the reclusive couple. Handwritten, politely worded, her company requested for an evening meal, dress informal, drinks at five.

She arrived punctually, alighting where a goat track veered off the old logging road and walking perhaps forty metres to the van. Motion to her left drew attention to a set table in a small clearing that looked like it had been hand levelled and kept with love. A picnic table and bench seats dominated the downhill end of the clearing, the top straddled by a bar between two small trees.

"Sophia! Thank you for coming. Would you like a drink? We have beer, several wines or whiskey if you prefer."

"He can also make you a G&T, it just never occurs to him anyone might like one."

"Oh, that does sound nice!"

"Ice?"

"In a G&T?"

"I told you she was civilised."

A G&T was forthcoming. He opened a beer for himself, and Trixie had a wine that she was ignoring as she zoomed in an out of a garden shed that appeared to have been fitted out as a kitchen.

"Don't mind me, I'll be at least half an hour here. Enjoy your drinks." Trixie vanished to bustle in the kitchen.

He produced a pair of folding chairs and motioned her to follow around a big pile of lumber, out into the larger open space she'd crossed arriving. It was not long after five and the sun blazed golden on the horizon, filtered through cloud and distant treetops. He placed the chairs for the sunset, motioned her to sit, and sat himself, pulling on his beer.

"There are a couple of reasons I wanted to talk to you."

She learnt that he bought the freehold title to the land, unencumbered and paid in full with cash, but the government changed its rules and would not hand over the deed.

"I am the Lord of this land, in fee simple," he intoned. She could _hear_ the capital L. "It is my right, my privilege and my honour to defend it and everyone who is my guest upon it. This is my duty to the Crown. Beautiful, isn't it." He gestured to the horizon where molten gold poured off the edge of the world.

He stood, looking expectantly at her, and she followed suit. Folding the chairs, he led her back to the dinner setting. Trixie was out of the kitchen and wearing gumboots, with another pair in her hand. 

"These will suit better than your heels, I'd like to show you something. You're definitely here at the right time of year!"

She doffed her heels and donned the boots, trailing in Trixie's wake through gloaming understory. When she caught up, the woman handed her another G&T, Heaven knows how she carried it at that pace through a darkling forest. The light finally went as they sipped and slapped at errant mosquitoes. 

"There!" Trixie pointed. In the dark, an owl hooted and she thought she saw a point of light. It winked out, and then there was another. Vision adapted, and the dim points scintillated. Dozens, hundreds of them. Trixie led, and somehow it wasn't pitch black any more. She could see the boles of trees as they strolled back through _thousands_ of motes blinking and swirling around them. It took her breath away and as they arrived back at the clearing she realised her eyes were moist.

"Magical, aren't they." She'd never seen him smile before. Grin, yes, but there was nothing cheeky about his mien as he rose from tending a woodfire stove on which Trixie's lidded pots simmered. In a silent dance they laid the table. She set out bowls of salads and vegetables while he flexed, lifting sizzling cast iron cookware onto trivets as though they weren't heavy. He took the head of the table, with Trixie to his right, and gestured to the seat at his left. She took it and they sat as one.

There was a tiny dish piled with coarse salt, and a narrow loaf of fresh-baked bread. He tore off the end and sprinkled a pinch of the salt upon it, offering it to her. She took it, and he said "Yours is the guest-right, mine is the honour." 

He tore off two more pieces, sprinkling them with salt and giving one to Trixie. In silence they ate the bread.

He smiled, and Trixie lifted off covers.

The fare was deceptive, simple looking but rich and well chosen. She tried the wine. It was local, he said. Smoky and plummy at the same time, sweet but strong tannins and not too acid, well suited to the ... lamb? Goat? Mutton? So tasty but so tender. Impossible but sublime. He poured gravy from a trencher over roast carrots and mash, inclining his head at her. She nodded, and with arm extended in another display of ridiculous strength he drizzled it over hers too.

They ate, and drank. The wine flowed freely. After, he played by firelight on his guitar. Then Trixie vanished into the kitchen, returning with desserts that brought them all back to the table.

The evening was cooling, the hour late. He dumped coals into a brazier and built it up to a cheery flame, seating them all upwind, until the inevitable shift.

I want my deed, Sophia. I want nothing that is not mine by ancient right. If it lies within your gift to make this happen, you will have my gratitude.

He did not mention it again, then or in any of the days that followed. She had her minions dig, and she read the laws, young and old, and decided he was right. There was nothing in the law that contradicted him, only the policy of a government that wanted to make its subjects dependent.

So she used her discretionary budget, and in ancient tradition had a vellum deed made up according to the law, and saw that it was sealed by an officer of the Crown, and had it delivered to him in a scroll-case, because that seemed appropriate.

The next day, a small parcel reciprocated. Inside, a ring-box contained a signet ring with a looping H she'd forgotten, not seen since she dandled on her grandfather's knee. Beside the ring-box was a strange rod of chocolate and orange, marbled with carmine, some tapers and a box of matches, all wrapped in a cloth. Under the little bundle was a handwritten note in an occasionally clumsy calligraphic hand, that read _'For missives that matter.'_

She put it on, and though it seemed to big at first, it settled around her finger, neither tight nor loose and not moving on her hand. She spread the cloth and rolled some paper. A match flared and her finger flattened the paper, presenting a seam. Wax melted, dribbling into a puddle across the seam. It was already hard in places. This was clearly a learned skill. 

Just for the hell of it she pressed her signet into the wax. She was right, it was already hard. But the ring was abruptly warm and sank smoothly into the wax. Withdrawn, she could see every filigree detail in the impression. Alien magic notwithstanding, a princely gift.

The note she gave to Eric was sealed. Trixie would know.

Eric reappeared within the hour, holding a pair of grey spheres with knurled meridians and numbered graduations.

"You twist the ends. The bigger the radius, the shorter the duration, it's an energy limitation. Trixie says he's being ridiculous, we should use the small one. She did some maths, that's why I was so long. Apparently it locks a sphere around it in space, but the planet keeps spinning and moving around the sun and also around the galaxy. She said never mind the galaxy we go round the sun at thirty metres per second and if it goes up and falls the big one is like a two megatonne bomb and if it goes down it will crack the tectonic plate and probably create a volcano."

"Can we turn it down?"

"Kind of. If we shorten the duration we reduce the effect. So instead of 6m and half a second, 6m and a tenth of a second is like 250 kilotonnes."

"Oh, only 250 kilotonnes. Just a little firecracker."

"Trixie says we should set it for a fifth of a millisecond."

"That's still two hundred tonnes! Or something."

"So we should stand well back, ma'am. We _are_ trying to kill it."

"What about the other hives? It might kill them too!"

"That might be a good move. We can always start again, and we already showed we're below whatever it needs, ma'am. Autumn will probably just start the next round and thank you."
