"You cannot be serious. I'm lazy. Thoughtless. Self-centred. Vain. I 'spose I'm not greedy. Apart from food. I don't handle criticism well. Even when I do things for others it's only because I need them to look after me too. I'm pretty sure the only reason I'm honest is I'm so bad at telling lies it's safer."

This is belied by his actual conduct and the gentle mercy he shows for animals that need his help. Which may be the final mercy, but this is not a casual decision.

He worries about the verified fact that his once astonishingly sharp (but lazy) mind is not what it was. Memory fails, and reasoning is following it, though fortunately not quickly. He likes being put on a pedestal but worries he might fail people, and not deserve it. Ironically, the harder he tries to live up to his own legend the bigger it gets.

There is a terrible inner conflict because Autumn has offered him implants to help with his failing brain but Trixie is dead against that kind of tech and he doesn't want to lie about it to her, especially because there is a possibility it could fail and widow her.

Forest is actually not that great at building things. He's terrible at woodwork and needs five goes to seal a pipe. He never gets anything right the first time. But he has a passion and an infectious enthusiasm, an ability to project a vision of what could be that is hard to resist.

One thing he does really well is oiling timber. He does it all wrong and it works anyhow. Autumn is convinced it's a manifestation of his absurd luck which _has_ to be some kind of quantum selection thing. He likes making handles for hand tools, especially axes and mattocks. He does this with a chainsaw, a knife and sandpaper. Sophia's desire for oiled timber grew out of an extended debate about paint and timber preservation, when she saw the lambent red-gold of his axe handle.

This feeds directly into his legend. Everyone who uses one of his tools carries that tactile memory of perfect balance and smooth grain. They remember the feel more than they remember his struggles with more complex projects. The handles become physical proof of his supposed mastery, even though they're really proof of something more mysterious - his weird ability to stumble into excellence through sheer bloody-minded persistence and supernatural luck.

And yet at another level, he is a sculptor. He does not force his will on the timber, that never works for him. Instead he finds the axe handle that was in the timber.

He doesn't drink much of the mead. He just likes making it with Oleksiy. And they both love artillery day. What boy doesn't love blowing stuff up?
