"You cannot be serious. I'm lazy. Thoughtless. Self-centred. Vain. I 'spose I'm not greedy. Apart from food. I don't handle criticism well. Even when I do things for others it's only because I need them to look after me too. I'm pretty sure the only reason I'm honest is I'm so bad at telling lies it's safer."

He worries about the verified fact that his once astonishingly sharp (but lazy) mind is not what it was. Memory fails, and reasoning is following it, though fortunately not quickly.

There is a terrible inner conflict because Autumn has offered him implants to help with his failing brain but Trixie is dead against that kind of tech and he doesn't want to lie about it to her, especially because there is a possibility it could fail and widow her.
