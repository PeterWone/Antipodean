# Glen Innes Crisis: Strategic Notes

## User Notes
- Evacuation is completely impractical: six thousand people, nowhere more secure than the current shelters.
- What they need to do is secure an area and build much better long-term shelters.
- This can be done with points; Dusty is a legend in the Vanguard and probably has the deep pocket required.
- The long game: get people to a secure shelter, build another, and so on, while mounting defensive actions.
- Need ten shelters with capacity for 600 each.
- Sophia is an administrator of people, strong in logistics and resource management.
- Dusty is an old hand at managing his bots and construction.
- The antithesis are showing coordinated, command-type behavior, making the situation more dangerous.

## Copilot Notes & Suggestions
- **Immediate Realization:** Mass evacuation is impossible. The only viable solution is to build new, robust shelters for everyone.
- **Dialogue Example:**
  - Sophia: “We can’t move six thousand people, but we can make sure they’re not crammed into deathtraps. If we can build ten new shelters, each for six hundred, we can rotate people out, reinforce, and buy time.”
  - Dusty: “You want shelters? I can build you shelters. Might cost a few points, but I’ve been saving for a rainy day.”
- **Resource Mobilization:**
  - Dusty leverages his Vanguard status and points to order prefab shelter modules, equipment, and supplies.
  - Autumn/AI coordinates deliveries, construction drones, and logistics.
  - Sophia organizes the population, assigns work crews, manages morale and communication.
  - Dusty oversees construction, deploys bots for labor and defense.
  - Forest leads defensive teams, rapid response to breaches.
  - Greaser maintains equipment, improvises solutions as needed.
- **Phased Construction:**
  - Secure and clear a defensible area for the first shelter.
  - Move people in, then repeat—each new shelter increases capacity and security.
  - Defensive actions are ongoing: repel attacks, adapt to antithesis tactics, protect construction sites.
- **Narrative Opportunities:**
  - Tension between urgency (building fast) and quality (making shelters truly safe).
  - Moments of hope as new shelters come online.
  - Setbacks: supply chain issues, sabotage, or major antithesis assault.
  - Character growth: Sophia’s leadership, Dusty’s legend, Forest’s resilience, Greaser’s ingenuity.
- **Victory Condition:** All ten shelters operational, population safe, sustainable enclave established.
- **Ongoing Threat:** Antithesis may adapt, requiring new strategies and possibly leading to a final confrontation with the command-type.
