In an Amish community, everyone learns a set of general skills essential for self-sufficiency and daily life. These include farming, basic carpentry, cooking, sewing, and animal husbandry. These fundamental skills ensure that every member can contribute to the community's survival and resilience.

Beyond these general skills, individuals often specialize in specific trades or crafts. Common specializations include blacksmithing, woodworking, tailoring, baking, and tool-making. These roles allow the community to function efficiently by leveraging the expertise of its members while maintaining a high degree of self-reliance.

The combination of shared general skills and individual specializations creates a robust, interdependent system where everyone contributes to the community's well-being.

They never did get to that. The valley was already inhabited by people with their own plans and dreams. But one thing they held in common: a desire to be out from under the thumb of authority, to be free to make their own decisions and own their mistakes.

All of them cultivated their own food. None of them had council approval for their buildings. There was only one road into the valley, and curiously it ran through private properties.

They met all the neighbours. To the west was Gerry, the tiler. East, Oleksiy, international man of mystery and builder of many things and his little Thai wife, Sissi. To the south, the Macintyre boys and their cattle. There were others, reclusive and seldom seen. No sealed roads; many of the properties barely had goat tracks. 

He had a lot of drones and servos and parts. Mostly they sat in shipping contains, idle and unseen by the world; there was much to do building a life in the forest. Nothing was by the book and they made many mistakes, learning many things and always doing better. The land provided: granite and red clay, and endless fuel from the forest. They chose a site and laid their plans, gathering rock. When the stockpile was huge, he bought in cement, and they dug and dug and dug, set into the slope on a ridge, chosen for good drainage and defensibility.

He bought huge steel beams and rented a crane, setting them into a slab in the dug out basement, the ends hanging out into space, waiting to support a deck hanging there. Would the council have approved it? He didn't know or care. It was safe, that was all that mattered. Strong and big enough for a helipad, not that he'd ever own a helicopter.

They stacked the rocks around steel reinforcement and mortared them, walls a metre thick. With timber forms around hoops of steel reo, heavily mortared granite became arches that joined up, domed at the ends. 

Domus sua cuique est tutissimum refugium. 

It wouldn't stop a bunker buster, but invaders would have to cross a drawbridge ending at a portcullis, then enter a corridor to turned ninety degrees ending at another portcullis. There wasn't space to swing a door-breaker, and even if there was the steel portcullis would laugh it off. If they were silly enough to go through the conveniently open outer gate they'd find it closed behind them.

If they were smart enough to try a gas grenade down the chimney they'd find it had an S-bend with a bottom hatch closed by a balance; the grenade would open it and drop out.

If they were genuinely smart they'd land on the balcony, kick down the glass doors and go in that way. Of course, the inside layout might be disappointing, the internal wall every bit as thick, the door as robust.

To defend against thermite and cutting tools the gate must be supported by area denial. Fixed emplacements should cover the gate with a simple cone of fire. Two trigger plates in the floor can provide a warning at close approach and then fire on anyone in arms reach of the portcullis. A power sweeper will be required to clear the pressure plate so the next idiot can suicide. The pressure plate should be supported by light-beam door sensors in case anyone thinks of jumping to the gate. The frequency should be high enough that night vision equipment won't see it. The trigger plates should reach the walls.

Simple and robust area denial.

Defensive drones must be hardened: semi-autonomous and equipped with advanced positioning systems and targeting software, responding to jamming signals by targeting the jammer. The use of autonomous drones requires effective FoF tags and if possible biometric identification.

If area denial weapons prevent approaching the wall above ground, sappers would be forced to rely entirely on tunneling to breach the structure. This would significantly increase the time and effort required for an attack, as they would need to begin their operations at a safe distance from the defensive perimeter. The heavy clay soil and embedded granite would further slow progress, requiring advanced tunneling equipment and explosives to clear obstructions.

To counteract these efforts, defenders could deploy seismic sensors to detect vibrations caused by tunneling activities. These sensors could trigger automated responses, such as deploying drones or activating countermeasures to disrupt the sappers' progress. Additionally, regular patrols and ground-penetrating radar could be used to identify and neutralize tunneling attempts before they reach the structure.

Collapsing the tunnel early offers significant advantages by preemptively neutralizing the threat before it escalates. By acting as soon as tunneling activity is detected, defenders can avoid prolonged engagements and minimize the risk of structural damage to the fortress. Early intervention also reduces the likelihood of intruders deploying countermeasures, such as breathing gear or reinforced tunneling equipment.

Seismic sensors and ground-penetrating radar could be used to detect tunneling activity at its initial stages, allowing defenders to deploy controlled explosive charges to collapse the tunnel. This approach ensures that the tunnel is rendered unusable before it reaches critical proximity to the fortress. Additionally, early action serves as a strong deterrent, discouraging further attempts by demonstrating the futility of such efforts.

While collapsing the tunnel early mitigates many risks, it still requires careful planning to avoid unintended consequences, such as damage to surrounding terrain or escalation of the conflict. However, the benefits of swift and decisive action far outweigh the potential drawbacks, making this an effective strategy for maintaining the fortress's integrity and security.

If intruders began using breathing gear to counter non-lethal measures like pepper spray or tear gas, defenders would need to escalate to lethal weapons to neutralize the threat effectively. Autonomous drones or automated systems could be equipped with lethal options, such as small-caliber firearms or explosive charges, to engage intruders directly within the tunnel.

Lethal measures could include deploying drones armed with precision weaponry capable of targeting intruders while minimizing structural damage to the tunnel. Alternatively, automated systems could release controlled explosive charges to collapse sections of the tunnel, trapping or incapacitating the intruders. These measures would require careful calibration to avoid compromising the structural integrity of the fortress itself.

An effective and decisive countermeasure against sappers would be to collapse the tunnel using explosives. This approach would not only neutralize the immediate threat but also serve as a strong deterrent against future tunneling attempts. Controlled charges could be placed at strategic points along the tunnel, either by drones or through pre-installed explosive systems, to ensure maximum effectiveness.

Collapsing the tunnel would require careful planning to avoid unintended damage to the fortress or surrounding terrain. Seismic sensors and ground-penetrating radar could be used to pinpoint the tunnel's location and determine the optimal placement of charges. Once detonated, the collapse would render the tunnel unusable and potentially trap or incapacitate the intruders.

While this method is highly effective, it comes with risks, including the possibility of structural damage to the fortress if the tunnel is too close. Additionally, the use of explosives could escalate the situation, drawing attention from authorities or provoking a more aggressive response from attackers. As such, this tactic should be reserved for situations where other measures have failed or the threat level is deemed critical.

A highly effective deterrent against tunneling attempts could involve deploying drones equipped as flying bombs. These drones could be programmed to deliver a verbal warning, such as: "Hi, I'm a flying bomb. You have two minutes to leave. If you dig another tunnel you won't get a warning." This approach would provide intruders with a clear ultimatum, giving them an opportunity to retreat while emphasizing the consequences of continuing their actions.

If the warning is ignored, the drone could detonate within the tunnel, collapsing it and neutralizing the threat. This tactic combines psychological deterrence with decisive action, discouraging future tunneling attempts while minimizing the need for prolonged engagements.

To ensure effectiveness, these drones would need to be equipped with robust navigation systems to locate and enter tunnels, as well as secure communication channels to deliver the warning. Additionally, safeguards should be in place to prevent accidental detonation or misuse. While this method is highly effective, it would require careful planning to avoid collateral damage and ensure compliance with ethical and legal standards.

Footage of warnings issued before activating portcullis area denial measures or collapsing tunnels could significantly enhance the secessionists' public perception while portraying the state as an aggressor. By documenting their efforts to provide clear warnings and avoid unnecessary harm, the secessionists could frame their actions as measured and defensive rather than reckless or hostile.

Such footage could show the secessionists issuing verbal warnings, such as, "This area is protected. Leave immediately or face consequences," or, "This tunnel will be collapsed in two minutes. Evacuate now." These warnings would demonstrate their commitment to minimizing casualties and adhering to principles of proportionality and restraint. When paired with footage of the state's military actions, this narrative could highlight the disparity between the secessionists' defensive posture and the state's use of overwhelming force.

Broadcasting this footage through social media, independent news outlets, or international organizations could help the secessionists garner sympathy and support. It could also shift public opinion by emphasizing the state's role as an aggressor attempting to suppress a group that has demonstrated effective governance and a commitment to self-determination. However, the secessionists would need to ensure the authenticity and clarity of the footage to avoid accusations of manipulation or propaganda.

The combination of area denial weapons and proactive defensive measures would make it extremely difficult for sappers to succeed without significant resources and time, further enhancing the fortress's resilience against such attacks.

To defend against the threat of tank rounds fired from a distance, the terrain must be carefully chosen to deny attackers a clear line-of-sight to the structure. Positioning the fortress within a natural depression, behind ridges, or surrounded by dense forest can obstruct direct fire from tanks. Additionally, steep slopes or uneven terrain can limit the maneuverability of armored vehicles, further reducing their ability to position for an effective shot.

Strategic placement of artificial barriers, such as berms or reinforced earthworks, can also enhance protection by creating additional obstructions. These barriers should be designed to blend with the natural landscape to avoid drawing attention. Furthermore, integrating the structure into the terrain, such as building into a hillside or embedding it within a rock formation, can provide additional concealment and protection.

By leveraging the terrain effectively, defenders can force attackers to rely on indirect fire or alternative methods, which are less precise and more resource-intensive. This approach significantly enhances the fortress's resilience against long-range threats like tank rounds.

To withstand mortar fire effectively, a structure must be buried deep enough to absorb the explosive force and prevent penetration. The required depth depends on several factors, including the caliber of the mortar, the type of soil, and the materials used in the structure's construction. 

For typical mortar rounds, a depth of at least 2 to 3 meters of compacted earth or reinforced concrete is generally sufficient to provide protection. In areas with loose or sandy soil, additional depth or reinforcement may be necessary to prevent cratering or collapse. Structures built into solid rock or covered by thick layers of granite or clay would require less additional depth due to the natural resilience of these materials.

To withstand atypical mortar rounds, such as those with higher explosive yields or specialized penetration capabilities, additional depth and reinforcement are required. A depth of 4 to 6 meters of compacted earth or reinforced concrete may be necessary to absorb the increased energy and prevent structural damage. In cases where the rounds are designed to penetrate hardened targets, incorporating multiple layers of blast-resistant materials, such as steel-reinforced concrete or composite armor, can provide additional protection.

Structures built into solid rock or covered by thick layers of granite offer natural resilience against such threats, but additional measures, such as sloped deflection layers or energy-dissipating barriers, can further enhance survivability. For critical areas, blast doors and reinforced ceilings should be installed to contain damage and protect occupants.

Defenders should also consider active countermeasures, such as deploying anti-mortar systems to intercept incoming rounds before they reach the structure. Combining these measures with terrain-based concealment and strategic positioning can significantly reduce the effectiveness of atypical mortar attacks.

Blast-resistant materials and energy-dissipating barriers are critical components for enhancing the structural resilience of a fortress against explosive threats. Blast-resistant materials, such as steel-reinforced concrete, composite armor, and ultra-high-performance concrete (UHPC), are designed to absorb and distribute the energy from explosions, minimizing damage to the structure. These materials can be used in walls, ceilings, and critical infrastructure to provide robust protection.

Energy-dissipating barriers, on the other hand, are designed to reduce the impact of shockwaves and debris from explosions. Examples include sloped deflection layers, which redirect blast energy away from the structure, and sacrificial barriers, such as sandbags or earthen berms, which absorb the force of the explosion. Additionally, layered systems combining blast-resistant materials with energy-dissipating barriers can provide superior protection by addressing multiple aspects of explosive threats.

For optimal effectiveness, these measures should be integrated into the design of the structure and tailored to the specific threats it is likely to face. Combining these materials and barriers with strategic terrain placement and active countermeasures, such as anti-mortar systems, can significantly enhance the fortress's ability to withstand explosive attacks.

Sappers attacking a stone building with metre-thick walls in hilly terrain with heavy clay soil containing granite rocks and boulders would face significant challenges. The heavy clay and embedded granite would make tunneling slow and labor-intensive, requiring specialized equipment such as pneumatic drills or explosives to break through the dense material. 

The most likely approach would involve creating a tunnel or sap to undermine the foundation of the structure. This could involve digging a shaft at a safe distance and then extending a horizontal tunnel toward the building. Once beneath the foundation, sappers could place explosives to collapse the walls or destabilize the structure. However, the presence of granite boulders would complicate this process, potentially requiring additional time and resources to clear obstructions.

Alternatively, sappers might attempt to use the terrain to their advantage by exploiting natural slopes or ridges to position charges against the walls. This would reduce the need for extensive tunneling but would still require significant effort to breach the metre-thick stone walls.

Defensive measures against sappers could include monitoring for vibrations or sounds associated with tunneling, deploying seismic sensors, or conducting regular patrols to detect and disrupt sapper activity before they reach the structure.

Secessionists could leverage their resistance to state enforcement by broadcasting a narrative that frames the conflict as an unprovoked attempt to kill them in their home. By emphasizing the defensive nature of their actions and portraying the state as an aggressor, they could garner sympathy and support both domestically and internationally. This narrative could be reinforced by highlighting their ability to demonstrate effective self-governance, maintain order, and resist external interference.

In their broadcasts, the secessionists could assert that sovereignty is fundamentally based on the ability to govern effectively and resist the imposition of foreign power. By framing the state as a "foreign power" unable to impose its will, they could position themselves as a legitimate governing entity. Statements such as, "We have demonstrated effective self-governance and the ability to resist the imposition of foreign power. This is and always has been the true basis of sovereignty," could resonate with audiences seeking to challenge traditional notions of state authority.

Proposing secession is not a request or an invitation to negotiate; it is a definitive statement telling the government to leave and relinquish its claim over the seceding group. It is an unequivocal declaration that the government has failed so profoundly that continued association is intolerable. Secession says, "We reject your authority, your corruption, your laws, and your legitimacy. You are no longer relevant to us, and we will not entertain any further dialogue."

This act is inherently confrontational because it challenges the very foundation of the state's authority. It is not a compromise or a plea for reform but a final repudiation of the system's ability to govern justly. Secessionists are not seeking approval or validation; they are asserting their right to self-determination and their refusal to be bound by a system they deem irredeemable.

By framing secession as a non-negotiable stance, proponents can emphasize the moral clarity and necessity of their actions. This approach leaves no room for misinterpretation or attempts at reconciliation, making it clear that the decision is final and absolute. While this may provoke strong reactions, it also underscores the depth of conviction and the seriousness of the grievances that have led to this point. Secession is not a step taken lightly, but when it is taken, it is a declaration of independence in its purest form.

Ultimately, governance and secession must prioritize the well-being and rights of the people over abstract principles or rigid frameworks. If principles are upheld at the expense of the people they are meant to serve, they risk becoming tools of oppression rather than instruments of justice. In such cases, those who prioritize principles over people may be seen as adversaries to the very democracy and self-determination they claim to defend.

Principles can only exist while there are people to uphold and embody them. Without people, principles are meaningless abstractions. Therefore, principles cannot be more important than the people they are meant to serve. To prioritize principles over people is to misunderstand their purpose or to wield them as tools of control or oppression.

Those who treat principles as more important than people are either misguided or acting with malicious intent. Misguided individuals fail to see how rigid adherence to principles can harm the very people they were intended to protect. On the other hand, those with malicious intent may exploit principles as a pretext to justify actions that serve their own interests at the expense of others.

True governance and justice require that principles remain subordinate to the well-being and rights of people. Principles should guide actions, but they must be flexible enough to adapt to the complexities of human life. When principles are upheld at the expense of people, they cease to be instruments of justice and become mechanisms of oppression. Recognizing this distinction is essential to ensuring that principles serve their intended purpose: to enhance the lives of the people they are meant to protect.

While government exists to act in the best interests of the people it represents, it is crucial to recognize that the government is not the arbiter of what constitutes those best interests. People are not children to be managed or controlled; they are autonomous individuals capable of determining their own needs, values, and aspirations. Denying them this ability is not merely paternalistic—it is a direct denial of their right to self-determination.

Self-determination is the cornerstone of individual and collective freedom. It is the right of people to make decisions about their own lives, free from external imposition. When a government presumes to dictate what is best for its people without their consent, it undermines their agency, dignity, and fundamental rights. Such actions are incompatible with the principles of democracy and justice.

The role of government is to facilitate the conditions under which individuals and communities can thrive according to their own definitions of success and well-being. When a government oversteps this role and imposes its own vision of what is best, it ceases to serve and begins to rule. This overreach is not only oppressive but also illegitimate, as it violates the foundational principle that governance must be by consent.

Secession is a direct response to this overreach. It is a declaration that the people, not the government, are the ultimate judges of their own best interests. By asserting their right to self-determination, secessionists reject the notion that the state knows better than they do. This act reaffirms the fundamental principle that governance must align with the will of the governed, not be imposed from above under the guise of benevolence.

This act reaffirms the fundamental principle that governance must be by consent and in alignment with the will of the governed, not imposed from above under the guise of benevolence.

Proposing secession is inherently confrontational. It is a declaration that the existing system of governance has failed so profoundly that continued association is no longer tolerable. It says, "We are so fed up with your corruption, your weaseling lawyers, and your laws imposed from on high that we have decided you are not worth the trouble and are irredeemable." This act is not merely a rejection of policies or leadership but a fundamental repudiation of the legitimacy of the state itself.

Such a stance is bound to provoke strong reactions, as it challenges the authority and identity of the state. However, it also underscores the depth of dissatisfaction and the perceived lack of viable alternatives within the existing system. Secession is not undertaken lightly; it is a last resort for those who feel that their rights, values, and aspirations cannot be realized under the current regime.

By framing secession as a response to systemic failure, proponents can emphasize the moral and practical necessity of their actions. This approach shifts the focus from confrontation to self-determination, highlighting the secessionists' commitment to building a system that better serves their needs and values. While the act of secession is inherently divisive, it also represents an opportunity to redefine governance in a way that prioritizes justice, accountability, and the well-being of the people.

A power that is already identified as acting against the interests of the secessionists, is aware of their objections, does not care, and intends to continue acting against those objections while believing it is entitled to do so, is not a neutral party—it is an enemy. Such a power has demonstrated through its actions and intent that it is fundamentally opposed to the secessionists' rights, values, and aspirations.

Recognizing this dynamic is crucial for framing the secessionists' stance. Treating such a power as anything other than an adversary risks undermining the moral clarity of the secessionists' position. It is not enough to object to the actions of this power; the secessionists must assert that its continued interference is illegitimate and hostile.

By identifying this power as an enemy, the secessionists can emphasize the necessity of their actions. Secession is not merely a response to disagreement or dissatisfaction; it is a defensive measure against an entity that actively seeks to suppress their autonomy and self-determination. This framing reinforces the moral imperative of secession and underscores the urgency of breaking free from a system that operates in direct opposition to their interests.

Government exists to serve, not to rule. Its legitimacy is derived solely from its ability to act in the best interests of the people it represents. When a government shifts from serving to ruling—imposing its will without regard for the consent or welfare of the governed—it forfeits its legitimacy. A government that seeks to control rather than empower its people becomes an instrument of oppression rather than a vehicle for justice.

This principle is foundational to the concept of self-determination. People have the inherent right to withdraw their consent from a government that no longer serves them. Secession is the ultimate expression of this right, a declaration that the government has failed in its duty and is no longer fit to govern.

By attempting to rule rather than serve, a government not only undermines its legitimacy but also alienates the very people it claims to represent. Such actions justify the secessionists' decision to break away and assert their autonomy. The act of secession is not a rejection of governance itself but a rejection of governance that has lost its moral and practical foundation. It is a demand for a system that prioritizes service, accountability, and the well-being of the people above all else.

The use of military force against a secessionist group occupying such a fortified installation raises complex political and legal implications. While deploying military assets might be seen as a necessary escalation to enforce state authority, it could also inadvertently lend legitimacy to the secessionist group by treating them as a distinct and organized power. This perception could arise from the state's acknowledgment of the group's ability to resist conventional law enforcement and necessitate military intervention.

Historically, the use of military force against internal groups has been framed as a domestic enforcement action rather than an acknowledgment of sovereignty. However, the optics of such actions can vary depending on public perception, international scrutiny, and the group's ability to present itself as a legitimate governing entity. If the secessionist group demonstrates effective governance, control over territory, and the ability to resist state enforcement, it may bolster their claims of independence in the eyes of external observers.

To mitigate this risk, states often emphasize the narrative that military intervention is a last resort to restore law and order rather than a recognition of the group's legitimacy. Diplomatic efforts, public communication, and legal framing are critical to maintaining this position. Ultimately, the outcome of such a conflict—whether the group is subdued or continues to resist—plays a significant role in shaping the long-term perception of their status as a separate power.

Maintaining a respectful tone, even when addressing powers for whom one has no respect, is not about legitimizing those powers or their actions. Instead, it is a strategic choice aimed at strengthening the credibility of the argument and appealing to a broader audience. Respectful communication demonstrates discipline, focus, and a commitment to principles of constructive dialogue, which can resonate with undecided observers or potential allies.

A confrontational tone may alienate those who might otherwise sympathize with the cause, as it risks being perceived as emotional or reactionary. By contrast, a measured and respectful tone underscores the moral high ground and reinforces the legitimacy of the secessionists' grievances and aspirations. It shifts the focus away from personal animosity and toward the systemic failures that necessitate secession.

Respectful communication does not imply agreement or submission; rather, it reflects confidence in the strength of one's position. It allows the secessionists to frame their actions as reasoned and just, rather than impulsive or vindictive. Ultimately, the goal is not to win the respect of the powers being opposed but to build a compelling case that garners support from those who value justice, self-determination, and accountability.

# Calling a spade a spade

The "Calling a spade a spade" section adopts a direct and assertive tone, which contrasts with the more analytical and nuanced tone of the preceding content. While this approach may resonate with readers seeking clarity and conviction, it reflects the urgency and moral weight of the secessionists' position as a minority group risking significant harm to assert their self-determination.

#### Strengths:
1. **Clarity and Simplicity**: The points are presented in a straightforward, numbered format, making them easy to follow.
2. **Moral Emphasis**: The section strongly emphasizes the primacy of people over abstract principles, aligning with democratic ideals.
3. **Recognition of Sacrifice**: The section acknowledges that secessionists, as a minority group, are willing to endure significant risks, including inconvenience, prosecution, and loss of infrastructure, to assert their rights.
4. **Resolution of Conflicts**: Point 7 addresses the potential conflict of interest within a seceding region, offering a practical solution (departure) while emphasizing the importance of consent.

#### Weaknesses:
1. **Tone**: The use of phrases like "enemy of the people" introduces a confrontational tone that may detract from the credibility of the argument. It risks polarizing the audience rather than fostering constructive dialogue.
2. **Departure Assumptions**: While the section emphasizes that those who disagree with secession can leave, it does not fully address scenarios where departure may be impractical due to economic, logistical, or cultural barriers.

#### Suggestions for Improvement:
1. **Balance the Tone**: Reframe confrontational language to maintain a persuasive yet respectful tone. For example, replace "enemy of the people" with "contrary to the interests of the people."
2. **Acknowledge Practical Barriers**: Expand on Point 7 to address cases where departure may not be feasible and propose alternative solutions for resolving conflicts of interest. This would strengthen the argument by demonstrating consideration for all affected parties.

By refining the tone and addressing practical barriers to departure, this section can better align with the broader context of the writing while retaining its moral clarity and emphasis on the sacrifices made by secessionists.
