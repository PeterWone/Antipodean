General Shortcomings in Early Chapters:

Overreliance on exposition and direct statement of theme.
Limited use of subtext, symbolism, and motif.
Character voices and internal perspectives are less distinct.
Emotional realism and stakes are underdeveloped.
Scene transitions and pacing are abrupt.
Setting and atmosphere are sparsely rendered.
Dialogue is functional, lacking nuance and layered meaning.
Revision Todo List:

Rewrite scenes to show rather than tell, using action and dialogue to reveal theme and character.
Deepen POV and internal perspective, especially for major characters.
Develop motif continuity (legacy, autonomy, resilience) through objects, dialogue, and scene structure.
Enrich setting and atmosphere with sensory detail and context.
Refine dialogue for subtext, voice, and emotional resonance.
Layer emotional stakes and consequences, making them felt rather than stated.
Smooth transitions and pacing for narrative flow.
Add nuance to antagonists and supporting cast.
Later Chapters (2.13+):

Use as stylistic models: richer internal perspective, motif integration, emotional realism, and narrative subtlety.
This list can be expanded with specific notes as you review each chapter. For best results, select one or two chapters at a time for focused revision, using recent work as a template for style and depth.
