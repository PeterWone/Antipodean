They will have to expand to produce everything themselves. To some extent they can populate with recruiting. 

They must inculcate anti-centralism with the underpinning reasoning and evidence in all their people. People who do not sincerely share this worldview cannot be allowed to prosper or achieve power.

Forest will have to deliberate set up benign feudalism with house charters and very clear constitutions that limit their privilege to this and this only, and expressly forbid the accumulation of wealth or any attempt to rule another person other than acts to suppress centralism.

This is an enforced prohibition on centralism in any form, and only that. It must expressly recognise the utility and efficiency benefits of system, and make explicit what the limits are: if every member of an organisation cannot name every other member and describe them in enough detail to show they know all their colleagues personally, it's too big and must be made smaller.

The charter motto is 

COOPERATE, BUT RULE NONE, AND SUFFER NONE TO RULE. 
WITHOUT EXCEPTION, AND WITHOUT MERCY.

Those who bleat of tolerance are misled, or trying to mislead. We do not do this because some ancient goatherd had a pen and too much spare time, we do it because _all of history_ shows that centralism leads inevitably to power and corruption and misery. 

When someone says: 'it is my people's custom to do this, you must respect our ways,' we say: 'Were it our custom to murder or rape, would your people smile and permit it?' The answer is no. If you pretend otherwise you are a liar or a fool. You will not centralise. It threatens everything and we will not allow it.

To those who answer with smooth words, say "Centralism is the ancient killer of societies and the anchor of greed and corruption. It is the performance drug of cultures that lifts them up and smashes them down again. We know you will gain from it, in the short term, and we know it will destroy your people and ours, if we allow this." 

If they cannot or will not see the reason in this then they are a threat. Our silent response to this is simple enforcement. We do not need to harm them, only prevent them from preparing to harm us. Take their tools so they may live out the story they write in their own lifetimes, if that is their dearest wish.

"I predict," said Forest, "an ephiphany after three missed meals. It's not as harsh as it looks. Anyone who values beliefs over even their own wellbeing is not an ideal contributor to any society. But those who are quick to agree without asking a lot of questions should be watched."

"Imperial China lasted three thousand years!"

"Imperial China was decentralised in its quotidian implementation. This is how it lasted. And it was centralised intellectually, which is why it failed to adapt to the greed of the expansionist, centralised west.

"I'll say it again. Centralism is the crystal meth of societies. In the beginning it's all benefits. By the time people realise it was a mistake, the whole culture is addicted and the fall is ineluctable."

Why do we make steel like this [from ore]? It takes too long and it uses too much fuel. It's much quicker and less wastful to melt down the car bodies. Even the rusty ones.

[Lecture on Roman Pot Syndrome]

Roman Pot Syndrome: When a society is surrounded by abundant, ready-made goods—like the Romans with their pottery—people stop learning or practicing the foundational skills needed to make those goods from scratch. Over generations, the knowledge is lost. When the supply of ready-made things finally runs out, the society can no longer produce them, and collapses to a lower level of technology. 

That’s why we must always teach and practice the basics, even when it seems unnecessary. Use what remains, but never forget how to make it from the ground up.

In the case of steel, it takes four times as much fuel to smelt ore. But in only a few generations the cars will have rusted away and if you don't know how to do it the hard way you're screwed. This is another example of how _efficiency is the enemy of resilience_. And the ritual preservation is the compromise that preserves.

Engineers love efficiency, and it underpins their magic. But first they master the foundations, or it will rule them.

You are learning to juggle. Efficiency, robustness, repairability, cost. There was a joke among the centralists: 'Quick, cheap, reliable, pick two.' In fact you can usually have all of them if you split 'quick' into quick to make and quick to figure out. Weird as it may seem they actually liked making things that worked well but not for very long. Why is complicated. It's late stage centralism, nobody _wanted_ that. Have you read Forest's _Fungus on a Corpse_?

Ewww. Gross!

The outcome is worse. He knew and he warned us. Now it's on me to get it through _your_ heads before you screw everything up with well meaning mistakes.

The look on their faces was too suddenly accepting. He knew he had his work cut out with this group. "No arguments? No thoughts of your own? He was a visionary, not a prophet, you know. He _wanted_ you to backchat him. 'An argument you cannot defend is yesterday's mistake and today's epiphany. An argument defended warms your mother's heart.'"

...

Don't look embarrased. That was yesterday's mistake. Look around you, do you think any of them could have lasted that long debating this? Mr Fenaluci here has no homework beyond writing up this debate. The rest of you will be doing that _and_ preparing to convince us you understood. The two of us will be up the front, explaining each other's position.

The Amish were a lot like us in practice. Their reasons were very different, though.

Religion is just stupid. Monotheism is as centralist as it gets!

Well done, that was as bigoted as any Christian. It also ignores their achievements and completely fails to ask why they were like that. Fairytales for people who don't want to die are as nearly as seductive as efficiency gains from centralising. 

What achievements?

It wasn't us who figured out reduction furnaces or steam engines, you know. That was the Christians. You can be right for all the wrong reasons and still be right. Which neatly leads us back to the Amish, who were deliberately decentralised and careful never to depend on anything they couldn't replace, repair or make.

Discuss revolution versus evolution versus planned break. Fungus on a corpse as intermediate phase (Roman Pot Syndrome)

Revolution is ironically accurate: going in circles, only the names change.

Evolution must go through viable intermediate stages.

Planned break: leaping the gaps to something profoundly different.
