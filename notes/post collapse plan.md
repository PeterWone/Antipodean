They will have to expand to produce everything themselves. To some extent they can populate with recruiting. 

They must inculcate anti-centralism with the underpinning reasoning and evidence in all their people. People who do not sincerely share this worldview cannot be allowed to prosper or achieve power.

Forest will have to deliberate set up benign feudalism with house charters and very clear constitutions that limit their privilege to this and this only, and expressly forbid the accumulation of wealth or any attempt to rule another person other than acts to suppress centralism.

This is an enforced prohibition on centralism in any form, and only that. It must expressly recognise the utility and efficiency benefits of system, and make explicit what the limits are: if every member of an organisation cannot name every other member and describe them in enough detail to show they know all their colleagues personally, it's too big and must be made smaller.

The charter motto is COOPERATE, BUT RULE NONE, AND SUFFER NONE TO RULE. WITHOUT EXCEPTION AND WITHOUT MERCY.

Those who bleat about tolerance forget that one can show only the respect that one is shown. All of history shows that centralism leads inevitably to power and corruption and misery. When another says: it is my custom to do this, we say: if it is were our custom to murder or rape would you smile and permit? The answer is no, and you will not centralise.

To those who respond with words, say "It is the ancient killer of societies and the anchor of greed and corruption, the performance drug of cultures that lifts them up and smashes them down again." If they cannot or will not see the reason in this then they are a threat. Our silent response to this is simple enforcement. We do not need to harm them, only prevent them from preparing to harm us. Take their tools so they may live out the story they write in their own lifetimes, if that is their dearest wish.

"I predict," said Forest, "an ephiphany after three missed meals. It's not as harsh as it looks. Anyone who values beliefs over even their own wellbeing is not an ideal contributor to any society. But those who are quick to agree without asking a lot of questions should be watched."
