## Roman Pot Syndrome

A phrase coined by Forest to describe a particular kind of civilisational trap:

When a society relies for too long on inherited surplus or technology—like the Romans' excellent ceramics—people stop learning the skills needed to make those things, because it's easier to use what's already available. Over generations, the knowledge is forgotten. When the surplus finally runs out, no one remembers how to make what they once took for granted.

Roman Pot Syndrome is the danger of losing essential skills and know-how through complacency and dependence on the achievements of the past. It is a warning: if you don't keep making, learning, and teaching, one day you'll need something vital and find that no one remembers how to make it.
