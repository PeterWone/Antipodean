He was more than a dog.
"Best practice" does not separate puppies from their mother until six weeks, but for whatever reason my sister brought him home at four weeks and dog care somehow fell to me. 

At the time I had hypotheses about the mechanism of learning for large pre-biased (instinct) neural nets and how intelligence and self awareness are created in them by interaction with others. I had experiments that treated the dog like a human baby to see whether the flame could be lit. 

It was. 

And then I had experiments involving the teaching of abstract things like "containment" and "thread" (fasteners based on a ramp around cylinder, requiring rotation to unlock them). You can, but not in a single step, and if you keep breaking things down you also teach problem decomposition and that REALLY lights the flame behind the eyes.

He became a menace. Capable of planning, independent of spirit. Nothing short of a padlock could hold a gate against him. I loved him dearly.

I didn't mind that no gate could hold him. "Bonzer, for god's sake stay in the yard please, I'm tired of hearing about it from mum" would actually work. Sometimes.

He had a spirit that was utterly indomitable. He wasn't the biggest dog on the block and he wasn't interesting in fighting but other dogs would occasionally challenge and the speed and casual indifference with which he put them down was astonishing. I don't think he ever contemplated the possibility of defeat.

He was perhaps one year old when we took on a pound puppy, a german shepherd whose history we later learnt when someone recognised her at one of my sister's parties and she answered her name. We had her over for "play dates" to check how another dog would be received. When we first knew her, she had clearly been savagely beaten; raising a hand quickly produced instant cowering. They got on well, and on the first day of her staying, as shadows lengthed they stood in the driveway expecting humans to take her, and when it didn't happen you could see them processing it. She was scheduled for a visit to the vet, but the next day she went into heat and they sealed the deal.

Those two would eat from the same bowl at the same time. Without squabbling. More than this: if you brought their meal, one would _fetch_ the other before eating. He who knew neither fear nor hunger always let her have her fill, until she too ate thoughtfully and stopped when sated. As the neighbourhood breeding bitch, instinct told all the dogs around (they visited with their owners) she was alpha bitch. Her confidence grew, backed by instinct and her mate's capacity to actually protect and enforce. 

Here's the fairytale end: four years later, coincidence brought her abuser to our fence, and he recognised the runaway. The evil prick _knew_ that harsh words and raising his hand would produce cowering, and he tried it. The result wasn't quite what he expected. She sailed over the fence and caught his wrist in her jaws, breaking the skin when she yanked it down. And Bonzer was out there too, behind the villain's feet, who stumbled backward over him and found two dogs staring into his face. One of them was the quietest, gentlest stone-cold killer you could ever hope to have watching over children.

That's not the epilogue. Two years later he was killed by a cattle truck and I buried him, though I could not see through tears. My friends came and helped me dig as we laid him to sleep the last time beneath his tree. And she who never barked at postmen, who did not mark boundaries with urine, who was his constant companion and the mother of his pups, she took on all those duties and did not falter in them until her hips gave out and she could not walk.


Forty years later they live in my dreams. They did not watch the gate. Gates were for cars and fences were no barrier, just steel markers. They watched the whole world, day and night. It was their kingdom.

"What did you learn from him?" It was the right question, and Janna's voice was quiet.

"How to be god."

"_God!?_" It was not an answer she expected.

"I saw him come into the world. I poured my spirit into him and made him in my image. I provided for him, I ruled his world but let him choose. I cared for him and I loved him. I made him more than he was and he returned the favour. I watched him grow and raise children. I watched him age and die. I have watched his children age and die. For him I was immortal and and all-powerful, benevolent when I wasn't capricious and uncaring. He taught me what it is to be truly free. He taught me how to simply be, and he lives on because I cherish him and keep his memory. Sometimes he visits me in dreams. Usually to defend me from nightmares, which he does with casual ease. The last time, I said 'How can you be here? I buried you long ago' and he spoke with words full of gentle disdain for my folly: 'I live in you. I'll always be there when you need me.' I haven't dreamed of him since. Haven't had any nightmares since."
