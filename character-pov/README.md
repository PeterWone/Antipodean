### Authority vs. Competence
Characters consistently choose competence-based relationships over authority-based hierarchies, leading to more effective and humane outcomes.

### Adaptation and Growth
Each character undergoes significant personal development, adapting their worldview and behavior to the realities of valley life and post-antithesis existence.

### Past vs. Future
Characters with troubled or constrained pasts (Oleksiy, Sophia, Rebecca) find redemption and purpose through building something better for the next generation.

## Writing Notes

These POV narratives are written to:
- Reveal character motivations and internal conflicts
- Show character development across the story arc
- Explore different perspectives on the same events
- Demonstrate how the valley community affects different personality types
- Provide insight into the philosophical and practical themes of the larger work

Each character has a distinct voice reflecting their background, personality, and role in the community while contributing to the overall narrative about building sustainable, voluntary communities in a dangerous world.
