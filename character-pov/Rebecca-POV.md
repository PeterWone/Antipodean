# Rebecca Morrison - Point of View Narrative

## The Communist Terror
My grandfather fled Hungary in 1956 with nothing but the clothes on his back and stories of communist terror. My father raised me on those stories: collective ownership means theft, shared resources mean rationing, community decisions mean mob rule.

When I arrived in the valley and saw what looked like textbook communist organization, every alarm my family had programmed into me started screaming.

## Brisbane Disappointment
We came here from Brisbane seeking the American dream my grandfather thought he'd found: individual opportunity, property rights, freedom from collective interference. What we found in the city was surveillance, regulation, and economic manipulation that made Hungary look free.

The valley promised escape from that disappointment. Instead, I found something that looked even worse: voluntary communism.

## The Kitchen Table Revelation
Sitting in Janet Henderson's kitchen, surrounded by women casually discussing resource sharing and collective child-rearing, I felt like I was watching the beginning of another nightmare. These women talked about community ownership like it was natural, normal, desirable.

But they weren't being coerced. No commissars, no five-year plans, no secret police. Just neighbors helping neighbors because they wanted to.

## Miklos and Freedom
Watching my eight-year-old son teaching local children card games, sharing homemade biscuits, laughing with genuine joy, I realized something important: he was experiencing freedom I'd never known.

Not freedom from responsibility or consequence, but freedom to be fully human in a community that valued his contributions. That's what my grandfather actually wanted when he fled Hungary.

## Scale and Accountability
Dr. Sarah Chen's point about scale hit me hard: my own family operates on communist principles because accountability is built in through love and proximity. The valley works the same way—too small for anonymity, too connected for exploitation.

When Maria mentioned that freeloaders can't hide in a community of two hundred, I understood. This isn't theoretical politics—it's practical organization based on human nature rather than ideology.

## The Flour Substitute Project
My arrival coincided with the children's flour boycott, triggered by Forest's impromptu lecture about monoculture. Watching valley kids apply critical thinking to food choices impressed me despite my ideological resistance.

These children weren't rejecting authority—they were exercising judgment. That's what I actually wanted for Miklos: the ability to think for himself and act on his conclusions.

## Economic Honesty
Tom Bradley's citrus problem revealed something beautiful about valley economics: people took only what they needed and shared the rest because waste is stupid, not because ideology demanded it.

When the women automatically began planning preservation sessions, they weren't following communist doctrine—they were applying practical intelligence to resource abundance.

## The American Myth
Janet's comment about the America my grandfather thought he was coming to stung because it was true. The promise was always a lie: "Send us your poor so we can exploit them while calling it opportunity."

The valley offers what America claimed to be: a place where competence matters more than credentials, where community exists without coercion, where people prosper through cooperation rather than competition.

## Miklos and Happiness
My father wanted freedom from collective interference. But watching Miklos thrive in the valley's collective support system, I realized that complete individualism is another kind of prison—isolation disguised as independence.

Children need community to develop properly. Families need neighbors to prosper sustainably. Individuals need social connections to remain human.

## Fear and Understanding
My communist phobia was really fear of powerlessness—being controlled by distant authorities who don't know or care about individual needs. The valley showed me the difference between imposed collectivism and chosen community.

When decisions affect everyone, everyone gets input. When resources are shared, sharing is voluntary. When children are raised communally, families maintain primary authority.

## The Range Mother Evolution
Joining the Range Mother network felt like betraying everything my family taught me. But watching children learn discipline, responsibility, and competence through weapons training made sense in ways ideology couldn't touch.

These mothers weren't creating child soldiers—they were raising citizens capable of protecting what matters to them. It was a quite a while before I accepted that as true; some of them were also learning strategy and tactics. It certainly _looked_ like indoctrination. Imagine my surprise when I found out the kids took their history class project questions to the only man they knew with relevant experience, and it grew from there. He knew all about ancient warfare, but it didn't stop there and it linked to their hobby.

## Educational Revolution
Valley children receive education designed to develop capability rather than compliance. They learn skills that matter, values that work, and thinking patterns that serve them rather than distant authorities.

Miklos is becoming the kind of person my grandfather hoped to be: independent, competent, free to make meaningful choices about his life.

## Personal Growth
Six months ago, I would have called the valley a communist cult and demanded immediate evacuation. Now I understand that voluntary cooperation based on mutual benefit isn't communism—it's humanity functioning normally.

The difference between communist states and the valley community is the difference between rape and love: similar mechanics, completely different moral universe.

## Looking Forward
We're staying. Not because we've converted to political ideology, but because we've found something rare: a community that works for its members rather than against them.

Miklos will grow up with skills, values, and social connections that serve him regardless of what political systems rise or fall around him. That's the best gift any parent can give.

## The Real America
If America ever existed as anything more than marketing copy, it exists here: voluntary association, mutual aid, individual responsibility within community support, and the radical notion that people can govern themselves without distant masters. Which is funny, because Australia is about as far from America as you can get.

My grandfather would approve. Not of the sharing—he never understood that—but of the freedom that makes genuine sharing possible.
