# Sheila Fenaluci - Point of View Narrative

## The Mother's Fear
When Shorty was posted to the valley as part of Sophia's staff, I wasn't happy about the move. Leaving the city meant leaving everything familiar—schools, doctors, shopping, friends. But orders are orders, and we packed up our life to follow his assignment.

I thought at least we'd have clean air and safe neighborhoods, everything a mother wants for her children. I didn't expect my ten-year-old to come home smelling of cordite and talking about tactical formations.

Forest calls me a Range Mother now. I've earned the title, though I'm still not sure how I feel about it.

## The Russian Spy Incident
When I learned that Oleksiy was teaching Aiden weapons handling, my first instinct was pure maternal panic. A foreign killer with a dark past training my child? Absolutely not. I didn't care about his redemption story or community standing—I cared about my son's safety.

Forest's letter changed my perspective. Not because he vouched for Oleksiy, but because he made me think about what safety actually means in the world we're living in.

## Shorty's Transformation
My husband has become a different person since we moved here. The posting that I resented turned out to be exactly what our family needed. In the city, he was frustrated, powerless, going through motions he didn't believe in. In the valley, he's found purpose and community.

Watching him realize that he'd never had real representation, that democracy was mostly theater, was painful but necessary. Better to face ugly truths than live comfortable lies.

## Aiden's Growth
My boy is growing up faster here than he would have in the city, but growing up better. He's learning real skills from competent adults who respect his potential. When he comes home excited about marksmanship or tactical theory, I see confidence and competence developing.

The other mothers worried at first. "Are we raising soldiers?" But these children aren't being programmed for war—they're being prepared for a dangerous world. There's a difference.

## The Range Mother Network
What started as maternal anxiety became mutual support. We mothers gather at the range not just to supervise our children, but to share the experience of watching them become capable adults.

Lisa keeping the boys honest about weapon maintenance reminds us that competence matters more than age. Sophia's friendship with the children shows that respect flows both ways. These aren't traditional hierarchies—they're functional relationships.

## Community Integration
The valley taught me that community isn't just geographical proximity—it's mutual investment in each other's welfare. When the Williams family ran low on preserves, Mrs. Patterson shared without being asked. When my family needed help, neighbors appeared without being summoned.

This isn't socialism or charity—it's how humans naturally organize when they're not being manipulated by systems that profit from division.

## Educational Philosophy
Dr. Sarah Chen's approach to teaching emphasizes critical thinking over information absorption. Instead of memorizing approved facts, valley children learn to analyze, question, and evaluate. They're being prepared for complexity, not compliance.

When Forest disrupts classes with impromptu lectures about monoculture or centralization, he's not just sharing information—he's modeling intellectual independence.

## The Flour Rebellion
My forty-year-old and ten-year-old both smell of cordite because they both take responsibility seriously. When Forest accidentally triggered the children's flour boycott, I was initially annoyed. But watching kids apply principles they learned to their daily choices showed me that education was working.

They weren't rebelling against parental authority—they were applying critical thinking to food security. That's exactly what we want them to do.

## Safety Redefined
I used to think safety meant protection from danger. The valley taught me that safety means capacity to handle danger. My son can't be shielded from a dangerous world, but he can be prepared for it.

When Aiden demonstrates proper weapon handling, when he shows tactical awareness, when he thinks strategically about problems, I see someone who won't be helpless when crisis comes.

## The Political Awakening
Living in the valley exposed the disconnect between government promises and government performance. Politicians claim to protect families while creating policies that weaken them. They promise security while eliminating the means of self-protection.

The valley children are growing up with skills and attitudes that make them independent of official protection. That independence is both valuable and threatening to established authority.

## Extended Family
Every adult in the valley has become an aunt or uncle to every child. Not through legal arrangement or institutional program, but through natural human bonding. Trix feeds them, Janna teaches them about ecosystems, Oleksiy trains them for defense.

This isn't replacing parental authority—it's supporting it with community wisdom and diverse expertise.

## The Future We're Creating
When I watch Aiden and Scott planning their games with military precision, when I see Lisa correcting older boys about equipment maintenance, when I observe children taking genuine responsibility for community welfare, I see hope.

These kids won't be passive consumers waiting for officials to solve their problems. They'll be active citizens capable of creating and protecting the communities they want to live in.

## Maternal Pride
I'm proud of the young man my son is becoming. Competent without being arrogant, confident without being reckless, prepared without being paranoid. The valley has given him something cities can't: real childhood in a real community.

When the time comes for him to leave—and eventually it will—he'll carry valley values with him. Independence, competence, community responsibility, respect for others' capabilities. That's a legacy worth preserving.

## The Range Mother Legacy
We're not just supervising children's weapons training—we're building the foundation for the next generation's success. Valley children will grow up knowing that safety comes from capability, that freedom requires responsibility, that community works when everyone contributes. And not one of them thinks weapons are toys. Well... alright, all of them including the adults think weapons are toys. But not to be toyed with, if that makes sense.

That's what Range Mothers really do: we raise citizens instead of subjects.

*Note: Sheila's perspective represents the maternal protective instinct adapting to new realities—accepting that preparing children for danger is more loving than shielding them from it.*
