# Forest - Point of View Narrative

## Background
I never asked to be a Vanguard. All I wanted was to build a cabin in the woods, live quietly with Trix, and be left alone by the world that's gone mad with surveillance and bureaucracy. But when the skies opened and rained murder-weeds on my forest, everything changed.

## My World
Ten hectares of stringybark, and ten hectares of abandoned pine plantation, with a creek down the middle. I wish it was ironbark and blackbutt, but we play the hand we're dealt. This is real Australia, the kind that bites back. Everything here evolved to survive drought, fire, and creatures that would give northern hemisphere naturalists nightmares. Every storm a few pines fall. To build we cleared on the pine side, I'm not knocking down good timber till I'm ready to mill it. Stringybark isn't ironbark but it's still Australian hardwood. My chainsaw is basically a Class I tool because these trees are tougher than most nations.

I chose this place because it's hard. Because it demands respect. Because it doesn't tolerate fools or bureaucrats, and if you're not paying attention, it'll kill you. It's honest in a way the cities never were.

## The Calling
When Autumn —my AI— first spoke to me, I was bleeding from a dog weed bite and running on pure stubbornness. She offered me power I never wanted and responsibilities I never asked for. But here's the thing about responsibility: sometimes it finds you whether you want it or not.

The irony isn't lost on me. A man who just wants to be left alone becomes responsible for protecting an entire ecosystem. A grumpy hermit ends up running what amounts to an intergalactic research project. Life has a sense of humor, and it's usually at my expense.

## My Philosophy
Rules exist to serve people, not the other way around. When the rules stop serving, you change them or ignore them. The government likes to call this "antisocial behavior." I call it common sense.

I don't trust authority because authority separates power from consequence. When you can make decisions that affect others while being insulated from the results, bad decisions become inevitable. I trust competence, integrity, and the kind of person who'll stand with you when things go bad. Oleksiy has a dark past, but I'd trust him with my life. Sophia started as a bureaucrat trying to control me, but she's learning. Eric does his job without trying to make it mine.

Both _ethikos_ and _morales_ just mean 'customs'. Legitimate just means 'written'. None of these things are binding. The rest of the world can get stuffed.

## The Sophia Problem
At first, needling Sophia was just sport — poke the Karen, watch her sputter about regulations and proper procedure. Harmless entertainment at the expense of someone who represented everything wrong with the system.

Then my glands announced, in Pythonesque fashion, "I'm not dead yet!" Which was both inconvenient and slightly horrifying. I'm twice her age, committed to Trix, and the last thing anyone needs is that kind of complication.

So I've been carefully professional ever since. When Trix suggested inviting her to dinner, I panicked slightly. But Trix knows me better than I know myself sometimes, and she was right—ignoring the elephant in the room just makes it bigger.

## The Valley Community
We're not building a commune or a cult. We're building something older — a place where neighbors look after neighbors, where children can grow up free, where competence matters more than credentials. The kids here learn to shoot because this is dangerous country. They learn to build and grow and think because those are useful skills. They do have customs. Breaching them is a very bad idea; most of them are danger mitigations, or resource and manpower coordination. [At this point Forest laughed. I asked why. He said the range mothers liked to refer to the blokes operating the range for the kids as 'Manpower'. He didn't explain why that was funny. It's no doubt a cultural reference.]

The mothers call themselves "Range Mothers" now, and they've gone from worried about their children learning weapons to proud of their discipline and accuracy. That's adaptation. That's evolution in real time.

## My Burden
Every decision I make affects the whole valley. When I buy a helicopter (because walking everywhere is for masochists), it changes the tactical situation. When I give Janna a rocket launcher, it shifts the power balance. When I let the government scientists play in my forest, I'm gambling with everyone's safety.

Autumn helps, but she's got her own agenda. She's using me to run her research project, and I'm using her to protect my people. It's a partnership built on mutual benefit and trust, but we both know who's really in charge when the shooting starts.

## What I've Learned
The antithesis aren't the real enemy—they're just a symptom. The real enemy is the mindset that says individual people don't matter, that freedom is negotiable, that safety justifies any sacrifice of liberty.

My forest is proving that ecosystems can resist the antithesis if they're tough enough, diverse enough, resilient enough. Maybe the same is true for human communities. Maybe what we're building here isn't just a place to live—maybe it's a proof of concept for a different way of being human.

## Looking Forward
They'll come for us eventually. The government, the corporations, someone who thinks they can take what we've built and control it. When they do, they'll learn that this valley breeds more than just tough trees.

Until then, I've got a forest to protect, neighbors to look after, and a cabin that's still not built. Some things never change.
