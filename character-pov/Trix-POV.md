# Trix - Point of View Narrative

## The Partner's Perspective
Everyone sees Forest as the Vanguard, the protector, the one who makes the big decisions. But I'm the one who keeps him grounded, fed, and occasionally clean. Behind every stubborn hermit is a practical woman making sure he doesn't starve while saving the world.

## Our Escape to Paradise
We came to the valley to escape the madness—the surveillance, the regulations, the endless bureaucracy that turned every simple task into an ordeal. Forest wanted to build a cabin. I wanted to grow real food without chemicals. We both wanted to be left alone.

The antithesis had other plans.

## The Organic Revolution
When I "put on a tinfoil hat" and started growing organic produce, Forest thought I'd gone hippie. But I'd seen too much—corporations poisoning everything for profit, governments enabling them, people getting sicker while being told they were safer.

Our food is clean, nutritious, and ours. No corporate middlemen, no regulatory capture, no chemicals we can't pronounce. It's a small victory in a corrupted world, but small victories matter.

## Becoming a Safe Harbor
When Forest started bringing home strays—first weapons for neighbors, then neighbors themselves, then government scientists—I adapted. Our van went from private retreat to community hub. My kitchen became mission control.

I don't mind. These people need what we offer: competence, integrity, and the radical notion that humans can take care of themselves without permission from distant bureaucrats.

## The Cast Iron Frying Pan
Yes, I defended our home with a frying pan. Not because I wanted to fight, but because sometimes you don't get to choose your battles. When killer plants attacked our door, I was ready to brain them with whatever came to hand.

Forest likes to joke about it, but he knows the truth: I'll defend our life together with whatever tools I have. The pan was symbolic, but the intent was deadly serious.

## Supporting the Mission
Forest doesn't see himself as a leader, but that's exactly what makes him one. People follow him because he doesn't want followers—he wants competent allies. My job is to help him see what he's building, to support the community that's growing around us.

When Eric comes by for tea, when Sophia needs someone to talk to, when the valley children want cookies, I'm there. Not because I'm naturally maternal, but because community requires someone to do the quiet work of connection.

## Medical Power of Attorney
When Forest gave me unlimited medical authority over his Vanguard account, it was more than practical preparation—it was absolute trust. He knows I'll make the right decisions even when he can't. That responsibility is both burden and gift.

It also means I'm effectively a Vanguard myself in everything but name. Autumn treats me as an equal partner in Forest's mission. The distinction matters to bureaucrats, not to reality.

## The Government Circus
Watching Sophia's transformation has been fascinating. She arrived as a typical bureaucrat—all rules and procedures, convinced that order required hierarchy. Living in the valley taught her that voluntary cooperation works better than forced compliance.

What's equally fascinating is watching her unconscious dynamic with Forest. They bicker like schoolchildren—him needling her just to get a reaction, her rising to the bait every time. It would be irritating if it weren't so obvious neither of them realizes they're doing it.

When I suggested inviting her to dinner, Forest looked at me like I'd grown a second head. "Why would we do that?" Not because he doesn't see the dynamic—he's too smart for that—but because he's been carefully keeping things professional. Sometimes men need permission to stop overthinking things.

The corporate scientists are harder cases. They want our technology without understanding our values. They'll learn, or they'll leave. The valley has a way of clarifying people's priorities.

## Range Mother by Proxy
I'm not a mother, but I've become aunt to every child in the valley. When Scott and Aiden need snacks after range practice, when Lisa wants to discuss the politics behind weapons training, when any kid needs an adult who listens, they find their way to my kitchen.

These children are growing up free in ways their city peers can't imagine. They're learning skills that matter, making decisions based on competence rather than authority. That's worth protecting.

## The Community Garden
What started as my private organic rebellion has become the valley's food security project. We're not just growing vegetables—we're growing independence from systems that don't serve us.

When Rebecca worried about communism, I could have laughed. This isn't ideology—it's practicality. When everyone contributes what they can and takes what they need, everyone prospers. It's as old as humanity itself.

## Security Through Hospitality
People underestimate the intelligence value of being the community's unofficial social center. When I serve tea and listen to conversations, I learn things that formal briefings miss. Who's struggling, who's thriving, who might become a problem.

Information flows through kitchens the way water flows downhill. By being genuinely helpful and interested, I become the valley's informal intelligence network. Forest gets tactical reports from Autumn; I provide strategic insight about human dynamics.

## The Future We're Building
Our valley is proof that people can govern themselves if they're allowed to try. We're not perfect—no community is—but we're honest about our imperfections and work to address them.

When the outside world finally collapses under the weight of its own contradictions, we'll be ready. Not because we planned for apocalypse, but because we built something worth preserving.

## My Role in History
Forest may be the Vanguard, but I'm the foundation he stands on. Every great man needs someone who believes in him before he believes in himself, who sees potential before it's realized, who provides stability while he provides protection.

I chose this life, this man, this mission. When history judges what we built here, I hope they remember that revolutions require not just fighters, but people who keep the home fires burning while the fighters are away.

The cabin still isn't built, but the community is. That's a fair trade.
