# Lisbeth - Point of View Narrative

## The Child (Age 6-8)
Everything talks to me, but grown-ups think that's silly. The animals don't think it's silly. When I ask Hettie to be gentle, she listens. When I tell the goats to kneel down, they do. When I explain to the ducks that they need to stay in their pond during the scary times, they understand.

Janna knows things. She listens to the bees, and they tell her secrets. She doesn't think I'm silly when I say the bilby wants to come home with us, or when I know exactly where the chickens want their nests. The other grown-ups smile the way they do when they think you're being cute, but Janna just nods and asks me what else the animals are saying.

My friends from town think the valley is magic, but it's not magic - it's just how things should be. Animals are supposed to be friendly. People are supposed to take care of each other. Plants are supposed to grow where they're happy. It's only strange if you think animals are scary and plants are just green things.

When someone is mean to animals, bad things happen to them. That's just how the world works. I try to tell them to be nicer, because I don't want bad things to happen to anyone, but some people don't listen. Then they fall down or get lost or bump their heads, and everyone says "what bad luck," but it's not luck - it's just what happens when you're mean to things that can't fight back.

## The Learning Years (Age 8-12)
The animals taught me about death before I really understood what it meant. My little bilby friend, Whiskers, got old and tired. Even though all the animals loved her and she was happy every day, she still got old. I asked her to stay, I asked really hard, but she just curled up in my hands one morning and went to sleep forever.

Janna held me while I cried and explained that death is like the seasons - even if you don't want winter to come, it always does. But winter makes spring more beautiful. She said Whiskers had a perfect life - no fear, no pain, no hunger, just love and sunshine and good friends. That's more than nature gives most wild animals.

I started understanding that my gift isn't about stopping all sadness. It's about making sure nothing suffers needlessly while it's alive. When animals get really sick or hurt, sometimes the kindest thing is to help them go to sleep like Whiskers did - quickly and peacefully, surrounded by love.

The queue of kids wanting to help with chores got so long that Janna had to make a schedule. Some parents worried their children were getting too attached to farm animals, but the valley kids just shrugged. We knew where eggs and milk came from, and we knew that caring for animals meant caring for all of their needs - including making sure they didn't suffer.

I learned that I could ask animals to do things, and they would, but I also learned to ask nicely and to think about what was fair for them. The goats didn't mind giving rides, but they needed rest time too. Hettie loved gentle scratches from the children, but she also needed time alone with her piglets.

## The Difficult Years (Age 12-16)  
Becoming a teenager while having every animal in the valley want to be your friend is complicated. The other kids thought it was cool that I could ride goats and pet dangerous pigs, but they started looking at me differently too. Like I was something magical instead of just Lisbeth.

The first time I had to help with slaughter was the hardest thing I'd ever done. One of our older rams had lived a good life but was suffering from arthritis that couldn't be helped. Dad explained that we could either let him suffer through a painful winter, or we could give him one last perfect day and then let him go peacefully.

I sat with the ram - Benjamin - that morning, scratching behind his ears the way he liked. I told him what was going to happen, and I swear he understood. He just looked at me with those wise old eyes and leaned into my hand. When the time came, he was calm. No fear, no stress, just trust. Dad said he'd never seen an animal so peaceful at slaughter before.

That's when I understood what my real gift was for. Not to make life last forever, but to make sure that whatever life an animal had was as good as possible, from first breath to last. The universe had made me responsible for their wellbeing, all of it.

I started helping with difficult births around this time. Somehow, when I was there, the mothers stayed calm and the babies came easier. Veterinarians started asking for me specifically when they had complicated cases. I couldn't explain how I knew what to do - I just listened to what the animals needed and trusted my hands to help.

## Young Adulthood (Age 16-25)
By the time I finished school, everyone in three valleys knew to call me for animal emergencies. I wasn't officially trained, but I had something better than training - I had trust. Animals trusted me completely, and that made all the difference in crisis situations.

I took over most of Janna's animal care responsibilities as she got older, though she still handled the plants and the business side. The queue of children wanting to help never got shorter - if anything, it got longer as word spread about our "educational farm experience." Parents drove for hours to let their kids spend time with animals that were guaranteed to be gentle and patient.

The practical magic of adult life meant learning to balance my gift with the realities of farming. Yes, I could ask the pigs to dig holes exactly where we needed them, but I also had to plan crop rotations and soil management. Yes, the animals never left messes in inconvenient places, but I still needed to understand proper waste management for environmental health.

I added midwifery to my unofficial qualifications. Something about my presence made births go smoothly - mothers stayed calm, babies came at the right time, complications were rare. The veterinary community couldn't explain my success rates, but they couldn't argue with results either.

Dating was interesting. Valley boys grew up thinking it was normal that I could communicate with animals, but outsiders found it either fascinating or deeply weird. I learned to downplay it around new people, just saying I had "a way with animals" rather than explaining that I could actually ask a cow to please move over and expect compliance.

## Adulthood (Age 25+)
I inherited Janna's role as the valley's unofficial animal authority and formal nursery operator, along with her precious soap cauldron - that magnificent piece of technology that could calculate lye ratios to the milligram and guide you through the chemistry of perfect soap-making. It took me years to discover that Autumn had designed it for much more than soap. The cauldron could manage any single-step industrial chemistry process - making fertilizers from animal waste, extracting plant medicines, even brewing the perfect fermented feeds for optimal animal nutrition. It was like having a chemistry laboratory disguised as traditional farm equipment. 

The bees taught me how to use it properly, whispering instructions that I somehow understood perfectly - the right temperatures, the correct ratios, when to add each ingredient. I thought it was just intuition at first, the same way I knew what animals needed. It wasn't until years later that I realized the bees were Autumn's teaching method, her way of passing on technical knowledge without intimidating me with formal chemistry lessons. She understood that I learned better through whispered guidance than textbooks.

The property expanded to include a small veterinary clinic where I worked alongside properly qualified vets who had learned to value my input on animal behavior and stress management.

My reputation spread far enough that agricultural colleges started sending students to observe my methods. I couldn't really teach them what I did - how do you teach someone to ask a sheep politely? - but I could teach them about animal psychology, stress reduction, and the importance of approaching every creature with respect rather than dominance.

The children's education program became formal, with parents enrolling kids in "animal husbandry and responsibility courses" that were really just organized play time with the friendliest livestock in Australia. Every valley child grew up knowing how to handle animals safely and understanding where food came from.

I never married, though not for lack of opportunity. The animals were my family, the valley children were my legacy, and the cycle of birth and death and seasons gave my life enough meaning for several lifetimes. Some people need adventure and travel and careers; I needed morning chores and evening rounds and the quiet satisfaction of keeping things safe.

People still said I had a gift, but I knew better. I just lived in a world where kindness was the default setting, where cooperation was normal, where trust was mutual. It wasn't magic - it was just how things should be, if you took the time to ask nicely and listen to the answers.

The bad things still happened to people who were cruel to animals, though I'd learned to stop warning them directly. Adults didn't like being lectured by someone they saw as "just a farm girl," even when I was trying to help. I left it to the universe to handle its own accounting.

## The Wisdom Years (Age 40+)
Looking back, I can see that my childhood seemed magical because I never learned that animals were supposed to be difficult or dangerous. By the time I might have learned fear, the animals had already decided I was safe. By the time I might have learned dominance, I'd already discovered that cooperation worked better.

The valley changed around me - more families, better technology, different challenges - but the basic rhythm of animal care remained constant. Feed them well, keep them healthy, treat them with respect, and help them through the difficult passages of birth and death. Simple principles that somehow created what outsiders called miracles.

The saddest part was watching other places struggle with problems we'd solved generations ago. Factory farms where animals lived in misery, urban kids who thought milk came from cartons, communities where nobody understood the deep satisfaction of caring for living things. We'd learned to live in harmony with our animals, and we were healthier and happier for it.

The proudest part was watching the valley children grow up and take that understanding with them into the wider world. They became veterinarians and farmers and teachers, carrying the knowledge that animals are partners, not property. Some settled in the valley and continued the tradition; others spread out to share what they'd learned in places that needed it more.

I never did figure out if what I had was truly supernatural or just the result of growing up expecting the best from every creature I met. By the time I was old enough to analyze it scientifically, it was too much a part of me to examine objectively. And honestly, it didn't matter. What mattered was that the animals were happy, the children learned well, and the valley stayed green and productive.

When my time comes, I hope I go like Whiskers did - peacefully, surrounded by love, having lived exactly the life I was meant to live. And I hope someone young and kind takes over the morning rounds, talks to the bees, and keeps the magic alive for the next generation.
