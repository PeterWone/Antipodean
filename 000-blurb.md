An SCS fanfic set in the Great Dividing Range (Australia) 

Ecology in Australia is... different. Hard-boiled, you might say. The animals are deadly, weird, cute, or all of the above. The plants are... well, let's just say that the trees petrify while they're still alive, and this doesn't kill them. They are in the very highest durability category; termites give up and make their nests out of dirt instead. The trees are so tough that Australian chainsaws are in the Class 1 Timberworking Tools catalogue. 

As a result, Australia suffers a lot less from incursions than northern nations. Hives are sickly and slow-growing, maladapted at a fundamental level to the potassium and phosphorus-starved environment. Famous for rapid adaptation, in this case, the adaptations required would strip away all the qualities that make antithesis what they are - fast-moving and fast-growing.

Unfortunately, this relative immunity left the Australian government largely intact. 

In some ways, a factual description of Australia sounds like the synopsis for a Judge Dredd comic book: a vast wasteland with almost all of the population jammed into a handful of cities in which a high-handed and intrusive ruling group is not shy about telling people what to think. At one time, the population returned the favor by treating the government with contempt and mentally simplifying the law to "look after your mates" and "it's only a crime if you get caught," but the rise of the internet enabled ubiquitous cameras. State-controlled media became blatant instruments of propaganda, and cities became luxury prisons. Many of the inmates were quite happy with this until state-sponsored corporate corruption made them poor, with the "protective" system frequently arresting people for vagrancy, which is the crime of being broke and homeless[1]. A contradiction of this culture is that despite a lack of trust in politicians, a majority accept at face value the claim that rules exist for the common good, and therefore it is acceptable to force others to trade freedom for safety.

A vile thing pretending to virtue, the government exploits this, encouraging mass media finger-wagging at those who refuse to toe the line. Vanguard activities are reported as irresponsible vigilantism, with emphasis on property damage and their casual disregard for rules and regulations. "Tall poppy syndrome" takes it from there, and the experience of Australasian vanguard is a far cry from the hero worship of the northern hemisphere.

Our... hero? ...had some luck and happened to own twenty hectares of forest surrounded by similar or larger blocks owned by people of like mind when he and his partner decided to remove themselves from the endless surveillance and overpriced substandard produce, to grow their own food, because it *does* grow on trees. Without pesticides or herbicides, yields are lower, but it didn't matter since they only needed enough for two. It turned out to be something of a mission, as these things always do. And then the skies opened, raining murder-weeds.

A man with a big chainsaw isn't the softest target. Chainsaw chaps are, well, they'll stop an _Australian_ chainsaw. When he goes on a weeding rampage checking on neighbors and generally protecting his world, a dizzy headache and an invisible friend aren't far away.

One of the neighbors with a dark past doesn't need a lot of protecting and goes with him to check on others and clear the weeds.

AI Autumn (n√©e Myxoma) knows about project Safe Arbor (Tarnished Honor) and realizes the Australian ecology already exhibits all these characteristics. Reporting this to the Protectors for consideration, she finds herself running a study on resistant ecosystems, allowing limited development of hives to measure and monitor the struggle between two extraordinary ecologies. It wouldn't work in the equally rapacious but much richer African ecologies, but Australia's dearth of key minerals significantly hinders antithesis growth, making such a study possible, if not exactly safe.

Large-scale field trials require field workers, and government and corporations are all over the study like a fat kid on a cupcake, loudly proclaiming their enthusiasm for it. Autumn wasn't born yesterday: they hope to make off with vanguard technology, to copy or use it. She expects to have a lovely time playing games of deception, pulling the mental wings off flies with her superior intellect. But humans are cunning, and they have played this game for a very long time.

[1] Vagrancy is a real offence. In Australia 2025 it is defined as "Being in a public place without visible means of support" ie broke and homeless. Hurrah for the commonwealth that rules for our protection and wellbeing.
