The Galya was a small private hurricane as I slid down the ladder, dropping a metre to the ground and waving them away. The double-bubble closed and turbines roared as Oleksiy returned to crop-dusting. 

Autumn marked sweep routes on my HUD and I followed one.

It was boring, but boring is good. Far from the main cluster, isolated foragers seemed confused and uncoordinated. Loaded with organic matter, they had no place to take it. The whole thing was a bit of a turkey-shoot, and my biggest problem was trying not to start fires with the nun-blaster. Fortunately the rain left things damp so they never got far out of hand.

And then I found a _cave_.

The idea that prehistoric people lived in caves is just plain silly. Caves are _rare_. It is true that there are dozens of limestone caves in Central Queensland, but that's very unusual. Most of them. it's a mission to get in or out. There _were_ caves at Texas, not too far from my valley, but they're all underwater because the government built a big dam in the eighties. People who want to see caves travel seven hundred kilometres to Central Queensland, or eight hundred south to Jenolan caves near Sydney.

Imagine my surprise, then, to find a cave just walking in the hills. That whole area is granite, which doesn't erode, and clay, which does. So I suppose it's not absurd to have a clay inclusion wash away leaving a cavity. But it's not common. Normally, as the clay washes out, the granite boulders fall together and there isn't a usable space.

Caving is _not_ something you do on your own. That's just foolish, it's dangerous. But then, hunting antithesis on your own is dangerous and foolish.

In my twenties I _loved_ caving, so there was no hesitation in combining my favourite ways to be foolish and dangerous.

"Autumn, I need a helmet and headlamp, and some gloves."

> _Also air, if you plan to use the Pyrothorn, which in a cave will be safer than projectiles, and possibly a large dose of common sense._

"I can buy that?"

> _Alas, no. I'm sure would be a bestseller with Vanguard WAGs._ 

Boxes appeared and numbers went down. As usual I paid them no mind. Autumn would warn me if it mattered.

> _The air is compressed. You have four hours of supply. Start using it now, another benefit is protection from the vapours of any fours. I'm not expecting them but you will be in an enclosed space._

"We need some eighties music."

> _Air Supply?_

"You guessed it!" I put on my new toys and wandered in. Autumn humoured me with some background music, not too loud.

The cave was narrow at first, forcing me to crouch as I moved deeper. The air was cool and damp, and the walls glistened faintly in the light of my headlamp. After a few minutes, the passage opened into a small chamber. 

What caught my eye immediately were the carvings on the walls. They were intricate, depicting scenes of animals, people, and what looked like constellations. The style was unlike anything I'd seen before—neither Aboriginal nor European. Some people gush about aboriginal rock art. If you ask me it's fingerpainting with mud. These carvings had a level of detail and storytelling that was architectural in precision.

Some of the carvings seemed to show figures holding tools or weapons, while others depicted what looked like mythical beasts. One panel appeared to show a group of humanoid figures standing together, holding up an object, while the beasts seemed to bow or retreat. Another panel depicted what looked like a hunt, with the figures chasing the beasts through a forested landscape.

"Autumn, are you seeing this?"

> _Yes. The carvings do not match anything on record. Given the location they may predate recorded history._

I moved closer to inspect the carvings. The figures seemed to tell a story — perhaps a myth or a legend about a great hunt or a battle between these people and the beasts.

"I wonder what it means."

> _The depiction suggests these people may have revered the beasts or seen them as adversaries. Or it might simply be myth._

Following a narrow passage that sloped downward, I moved deeper into the cave. The air cooled, and the walls were rougher, with fewer carvings. My headlamp flickered briefly, and I tapped it to bring the light back to full strength. Weird. Protector-grade torches do _not_ play up.

Then I heard it—a faint clicking sound, like claws on stone. I froze.

"Did you hear that?"

> _Movement forward, range twenty meters. Multiple units._

"Antithesis?"

> _Are you expecting goblins?_

I gripped the nun-blaster, choosing a low-intensity setting to avoid igniting the confined space. The passage widened into another chamber, and my headlamp lit the source of the noise — three antithesis units. Massive, their forms a grotesque cross between a stegosaurus and a bear. Jagged, bony plates ran down their spines. Muscular, ursine limbs and faces. Their heavy breath echoed in the chamber.

As one they erupted in my direction, unnervingly fast for their size. I fired, drenching the nearest in Greek Fire. In eerie silence it twisted, collapsing with bony plates so hot they glowed. As a last act of spite it flung a spike from its tail, narrowly missing my shoulder and embedding itself in the wall behind me.

The other two split, flanking with surprising coordination. I turned fire on the near unit. The burst went wide, scorching the wall instead. It seized the initiative and a flick of its tail launched a spike that struck my thigh tangentially, ripping through the chaps and grazing my leg. The pain was immediate and excruciating. My leg buckled and I all but dropped the nun-blaster.

"Faaaaargh!" I grit my teeth against the pain.

> _Eloquent. A surface wound, envenomed. Movement will be impaired. Want your nanites?_

I ignored her summary of the obvious. The injured beast advanced, and prepared to strike again. Steadied by the wall, I aimed with more care. Flames engulfed it, and the flopping of its death throes would have been more entertaining had I been less concerned about the other.

The last one lunged, its claws swiping dangerously close. Dodging sent a fresh wave of nasty through my leg. Its tail whipped around in thagomiser mode. I weaved and _felt_ it whistle past, pulling the creature aside with its own momentum. With the last of my endurance I scuttled back and fired.

The Jabberwock, with eyes and just about everything else aflame, whiffled through the tulgey wood at ramming speed. Lewis Carroll seriously undersold how terrifying these things were. It smashed into me, a caring, sharing move that flung me back but also smeared holy fire right down my lumberjacket. I had to get it off fast; that stuff is _hot_ and it doesn't go out. But first the Trenchmaker barked rebuke. Four shots, three misses. The hit was a ricochet but a win is a win.

The chamber reeked of charred mould and lawn clippings. Death throes echoed off the stone walls, the whispering hiss as its juices boiled sending shivers down my spine. Against the sussurus of flame my breath rasped. My leg hurt. I leaned heavily against the wall and made inarticulate groaning sounds.

Autumn's did her best Arnie.

> _You need a vacation._

"No shit, Sherlock" I muttered. Trying to rise, I winced and decided this was a terrible plan. At least three ribs cracked. By contrast my leg didn't hurt so much. It throbbed and felt... infected. Hot. Swollen. Turgid even, and not in a saucy way.

"Nanites. Woundstop. Jacket and chaps."

> _Manners._

"You won't let me die. Who would you mock?"

> _I might let you suffer. That could be fun!_

"I love you too."

Boxes appeared. _What_ is the Protector fascination with packaging?

"I should have brought the SPNKr."

One of those appeared too. The sharp metallic taste of the nanites sparkled in my throat, provoking a hacking cough that bloody hurt. I passed out, right there, Woundstop unused in my hand.

The world swayed. No, I was swaying. Eric's face hovered above me, his expression a mix of relief and exasperation.

"Took you long enough," I muttered, my voice hoarse.

"You're welcome," he replied. "Next time, go in _with_ the cavalry."

"I _am_ the cavalry." A pause. "Cavalry doesn't do well in confined spaces."

The stretcher jostled as they carried me out of the cave. The cool air of the chamber gave way to the clean smell of recent rain, with a hint of lawn clippings. Ribs howled at every thump and bump, piquant reminder of my limits.

The sharp crack of pistol fire roused me. Eric and his boys were defending their position, surrounded on all sides by swarms of tiny antithesis. Mostly they were big fat aggressive caterpillar, thirty centimetres at most. But the chopper couldn't dust them with us there, and pistols weren't fast enough. None were a threat on their own, but sheer numbers made them a problem. As medevacs go it wasn't our finest hour.

The helo thundered above, rotors kicking up a storm of leaves and debris. They were clipping the stretcher to a hoisting harness when I shook off the haze and climbed out. I muttered under my breath: "Why do these fuckin' things remind me so much of the Flood?" 

If anyone heard that, it was Autumn. She said nothing.

"Forest, what the hell are you doing?" Eric shouted, his voice barely audible over the chaos.

"Rescuing my rescuers," I replied, producing a pair of SMGs from nowhere. "Thanks, Autumn."

> _You're welcome. Try not to die, **Chief**._

So she _did_ hear that. I opened fire, hosing down the carpet of invaders left and right. The SMGs rattled in my hands, their muzzles spitting fire as the little monsters fell in droves. 

"Eric, get the sling off the stretcher and throw it to me!" I bellowed over the downdraft. He did, and I lashed a bosun's chair out of it. "Take me up a bit!"

Eric hesitated for a moment before using his radio. "Lift him for covering fire! Go up three metres."

As the harness lifted me into the air, I tossed an SMG to each of Eric's helpers. "Cover the flanks!" I shouted, then threw the Trenchmaker to Eric. "You're on big-game duty!"

Eric caught the weapon with a grim nod. 

"Don't miss."

"Spray and pray!" I grinned. Securely twined around the strap, hands out expectantly, I caught two more SMGs as Autumn did her thing. "Autumn, magazine changes all round. Ground is fine. The harness jerked and I lifted, view of the battlefield steadily improving. If any stego-bears turned up I was a sitting duck. A hanging duck, whatever.

Brandishing the SMGs while we rose, all I needed to look like a middle-eastern maniac was a head-band and missing teeth. Like an avenging angel I rained fire from above, SMGs chattering as the tide of antithesis units thinned. They tended to walk up, but I let my arms fall between bursts. It was a good pattern, not too taxing.

Remembering, I looked down and bellowed "Hey, where's my SPNKr?"

Eric pointed at a duffle bag. Nothing large required the Trenchmaker and certainly not a rocket launcher, so he focussed on coordinating his team. One of them had the nun-blaster and used it for area denial, spraying no-go lines on the ground like flaming ketchup. Caterpillars that ignored it got halfway and burst like popcorn.

From my vantage it became obvious what to do. I threw flesh-melter after flesh-melter as far as I could, then set them all off together. This and the combined firepower of our group turned the tide. The situation briefly under control, Oleksiy brought me down. 

Slipping out of my improv harness, I ran back to the group. With me out of the way and where he could see me, Oleksiy set down, opened the bubble and popped off a few shots at stragglers. I think he felt left out.

The last of the horde fell, and the hills grew eerily quiet. I stood there, breathing heavily, the acrid smell of cordite in both nostrils.

"Well," I said, "that was fun!"

"Next time," Eric called up to me, "stay in the stretcher."

"Where's the fun in that?" I replied, grinning despite the pain in my ribs.

> _How much common sense would you like to buy?_

"Yes, dear.

"**Right, you lot. Autumn's gunna give me toys that let me walk in the dust of doom&mdash;**"

> _I am?_

"You are. _Stop interrupting my dramatic speech_.

"**&mdash;but the rest of you are getting in the chopper so Oleksiy can spray. There aren't enough seats but you aren't going far. I'm _walking_ out. Someone give me a radio &mdash; great, thank you. Right, all aboard!**"

The Galya has a big compartment aft of the main rotor. Depending on fit-out it can be extra munitions or troop transport. Sophia and Oleksiy hauled everything they could lift out of there and threw it out onto the ground. We'd have to come back, but that wasn't a now problem.

All her people in, they lifted while I mucked about with a hazmat suit from Autumn. I gave Oleksiy a two-handed wave and thumbs up, then remembered I had a radio. 

"All sealed up and ready to go! Probably should have done that while there was someone to check, but we live and learn. Or we die and don't."

"Not funny!" said Sophia.

"You _do_ care!"

"_So_ much paperwork."

"Hah. You love it!"

She did laugh, but the radio cut off. Probably Oleksiy getting rid of chatter.
