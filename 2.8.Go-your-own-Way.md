The Galya hovered noisily as I slid down the ladder, dropping a metre to the ground and waving them away. Its turbines roared as Oleksiy returned to crop-dusting. 

Autumn marked several sweep routes on my HUD and I followed them.

It was boring, but boring is good. Far from the main cluster, isolated foragers seemed confused and uncoordinated. Loaded with organic matter, they had no place to take it. The whole thing was a bit of a turkey-shoot, and my biggest problem was trying not to start fires with the nun-blaster. Fortunately the rain left things damp so they never got far out of hand.

And then I found a _cave_.

The fantasy of prehistoric people living in caves is just plain silly, because caves are _rare_. There are dozens of limestone caves in Central Queensland, but that's very unusual, and most of them it's a mission to get in or out. There _were_ caves at Texas, not too far from my valley, but they're all underwater because the government built a big dam. So people who want to see caves travel seven hundred kilometres to Central Queensland.

Imagine my surprise, then, to find a cave just walking in the hills. That whole area is granite, which doesn't erode, and clay, which does. So I suppose it's not absurd to have a clay inclusion wash away leaving a cavity. But it's not common.

Caving is _not_ something you do on your own. That's just foolish, it's dangerous. But then, hunting antithesis on your own is dangerous and foolish.

In my twenties I _loved_ caving, so there was no hesitation in combining my favourite ways to be foolish and dangerous.

"Autumn, I need a helmet and headlamp, and some gloves."

> _Also air, if you plan to use the Pyrothorn, which in a cave will be safer than projectiles, and possibly a large dose of common sense._

"I can buy that?"

> _Alas, no. I'm sure would be a bestseller._ 

Boxes appeared and numbers went down. As usual I paid them no mind. Autumn would warn me if it mattered.

> _The air is compressed. You have four hours of it. Another benefit is protection from the vapours of any fours &mdash; you will be in an enclosed space._
