The Galya hovered noisily as I slid down the ladder, dropping a metre to the ground and waving them away. Its turbines roared as Oleksiy returned to crop-dusting. 

Autumn marked several sweep routes on my HUD and I followed them.

It was boring, but boring is good. Far from the main cluster, isolated foragers seemed confused and uncoordinated. Loaded with organic matter, they had no place to take it. The whole thing was a bit of a turkey-shoot, and my biggest problem was trying not to start fires with the nun-blaster. Fortunately the rain left things damp so they never got far out of hand.

And then I found a _cave_.

The idea that prehistoric people lived in caves is just plain silly. Caves are _rare_. It is true that there are dozens of limestone caves in Central Queensland, but that's very unusual. Most of them. it's a mission to get in or out. There _were_ caves at Texas, not too far from my valley, but they're all underwater because the government built a big dam in the eighties. People who want to see caves travel seven hundred kilometres to Central Queensland, or eight hundred south to Jenolan caves near Sydney.

Imagine my surprise, then, to find a cave just walking in the hills. That whole area is granite, which doesn't erode, and clay, which does. So I suppose it's not absurd to have a clay inclusion wash away leaving a cavity. But it's not common. Normally, as the clay washes out, the granite boulders fall together and there isn't a usable space.

Caving is _not_ something you do on your own. That's just foolish, it's dangerous. But then, hunting antithesis on your own is dangerous and foolish.

In my twenties I _loved_ caving, so there was no hesitation in combining my favourite ways to be foolish and dangerous.

"Autumn, I need a helmet and headlamp, and some gloves."

> _Also air, if you plan to use the Pyrothorn, which in a cave will be safer than projectiles, and possibly a large dose of common sense._

"I can buy that?"

> _Alas, no. I'm sure would be a bestseller with Vanguard WAGs._ 

Boxes appeared and numbers went down. As usual I paid them no mind. Autumn would warn me if it mattered.

> _The air is compressed. You have four hours of supply. Start using it now, another benefit is protection from the vapours of any fours. I'm not expecting them but you will be in an enclosed space._

"We need some eighties music."

> _Air Supply?_

"You guessed it!" I put on my new toys and wandered in. Autumn humoured me with some background music, not too loud.

The cave was narrow at first, forcing me to crouch as I moved deeper. The air was cool and damp, and the walls glistened faintly in the light of my headlamp. After a few minutes, the passage opened into a small chamber. 

What caught my eye immediately were the carvings on the walls. They were intricate, depicting scenes of animals, people, and what looked like constellations. The style was unlike anything I'd seen before—neither Aboriginal nor European. Aboriginal rock art, while culturally significant, always struck me as crude fingerpainting with mud. These carvings, however, had a level of detail and storytelling that was almost architectural in precision.

Some of the carvings seemed to show figures holding tools or weapons, while others depicted what looked like large, mythical beasts. One panel appeared to show a group of humanoid figures standing together, holding up an object, while the beasts seemed to bow or retreat. Another panel depicted what looked like a hunt, with the figures chasing the beasts through a forested landscape.

"Autumn, are you seeing this?"

> _Yes. The carvings are consistent with no known cultural patterns in the database. They may predate recorded history._

I moved closer to inspect the carvings. The figures seemed to tell a story—perhaps a myth or a legend about a great hunt or a battle between these people and the beasts.

"I wonder what it means."

> _The depiction suggests these people may have revered the beasts or seen them as adversaries. Or it might simply be mythology._

Following a narrow passage that sloped downward, I moved deeper into the cave. The air cooled, and the walls were rougher, with fewer carvings. My headlamp flickered briefly, and I tapped it to bring the light back to full strength. Weird. Protector-grade torches do _not_ play up.

Then I heard it—a faint clicking sound, like claws on stone. I froze.

"Did you hear that?"

> _Movement detected approximately twenty meters ahead. Multiple entities._

"Antithesis?"

> _Are you expecting goblins?_

I gripped the Pyrothorn tightly, switching it to a low-intensity setting to avoid igniting the confined space. The passage widened into another chamber, and my headlamp illuminated the source of the noise — three antithesis units. Massive, their forms a grotesque cross between a stegosaurus and a bear. Jagged, bony plates ran down their spines. Muscular, ursine limbs and faces. Their heavy breath echoed in the chamber.

The creatures charged, unnervingly fast for their size. I fired the Pyrothorn, the flames engulfing the first unit. In eerie silence it shuddered in silent agony, bony plates so hot they glowed. Before collapsing, it flung a spike from its tail, narrowly missing my shoulder and embedding itself in the wall behind me.

The other two split, flanking me with surprising coordination. I turned to fire at the nearer unit. My shot went wide, scorching the wall instead. It seized the initiative. Swinging its tail it launched a spike that struck my thigh tangentially, ripping through the chaps and grazing my leg. The pain was immediate and excruciating, like molten metal. I stumbled, nearly dropping the Pyrothorn as my leg buckled.

"Faaaaargh!" I grit my teeth against the pain.

> _As usual, your eloquence is astonishing. A surface wound, envenomed. Movement will be impaired. Want your nanites?_

I ignored her summary of the obvious. The injured beast advanced, and prepared to strike again. Steadied by the wall, I aimed carefully this time. Flames engulfed it, and it thrashing violently before collapsing in a heap.

The last one lunged, its claws swiping dangerously close. Dodging sent a fresh wave of pain through my leg. Its tail whipped around in thagomiser mode, and I ducked just in time to avoid impalement. With the last of my endurance I scuttled back and fired. With a silent snarl it charged. Thrown back by the impact, smeared with burny nun-juice, I had to get my jacket off fast; aflame and not going out. But first the Trenchmaker barked refusal of the stego-bear's next try. Four shots, three misses. The hit was a ricochet but a win is a win.

The chamber fell silent except for the sound of my ragged breathing and the faint crackle of flames. My leg throbbed with every heartbeat, and I leaned heavily against the wall.

"Fuaaaaarck."

Autumn's did her best Arnie.

> _You need a vacation._

"No shit, Sherlock" I muttered, wincing, trying to rise and deciding this was a shit plan. At least three ribs cracked. By contrast my leg didn't hurt so much. It throbbed and felt... infected. Hot. Swollen.

"Nanites. Woundstop. New jacket and chaps."

> _Manners._

"You won't let me die. Who would you mock?"

> _I might let you suffer. That sounds like fun!_

"I love you too."

Boxes appeared. What is the Protector fascination with packaging?
