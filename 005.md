"I need a weapon."

> _I **do** know how to pick 'em. Bullet, bomb or burn?_

"Any of my catalogue have a flamethrower?"

> _No. How about M19 rounds?_

"Thermobaric?"

> _In a forest?_

"One problem at a time."

> _Alright. It's your forest anyway._

A case appeared on the ground, already open, with a clip for the M41. Ejecting the old clip with a round still in it, I slapped the new one in and let all four fly.

> _Will you look at that, a newborn nest. Someone got lucky today! 

Anything will burn if you fill it with white phosphorus. The whole thing writhed frantically, with a sound like popcorn as seedpods burst. Flaming half grown dog weeds ran in all directions and I began to worry about the fire spreading. Both of us steadily potted them but the fire was spreading. Luckily it rained yesterday and the understory was fairly damp, only burning where the dog weeds fell.

"Autumn, do you know the implement used to control a canefire last century?"

> _I don't currently have network access._

"Like a broom except instead of a brush there's a wire and a wet hessian sack like a flag but in line with the handle instead of being at ninety degrees. Two of them and a trough of water to wet them in." 

We ambled from kill to kill, following the scorchmarks and putting out first one kind of fire and then the other till none were left and the nascent nest was no longer a conflagration, just a fire with satellites.

"You sounded pretty excited about the nest."

> _Yes! Your first token, chief! And quite a few points.

"Token?"

> _We need to talk._

"That sounds ominous. Talk."

> _Privately._

"That sounds worse. Fine, have we got enough points to leave Jim with some spare Hummingbirds and some clips for the M41?" 

> _They're in the tray, Jim. Lazybones here will help you carry them into the house. He also bought you a sling for the launch clips, some webbing and holsters for two Hummingbirds and a pair of binoculars._

"I have catalogues and points for all that?"

> _You don't need catalogues for Class 0 stuff, which is anything you can buy retail. And the bonfire was profitable. We should do that more often._

"Right. Jim, let's get you back home before Sissi gets pissy. She's scary. I'm going to have to go. You have my number if you need help or ammo." Signal here is patchy but SMS works. He doesn't need instruction, that would be telling granny how to drink vodka.
