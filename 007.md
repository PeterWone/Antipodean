It took weeks to find all of them. There's just too much land to search, but in the end it didn't matter. Once they ate the meagre fare around them, they came to us.

The first time, it was the lowing of cattle from the pasture lands to the south that alerted us. The Macintyres' bull gored and trampled five or six dog weeds but there were more hanging off and eventually one of those worms burrowed into him. The Macintyre boys arrived and opened fire on the dog weeds. 

The worm must have been still setting up shop because Banana was stock still and trembling while they stood around wondering what was wrong with him. I don't think they'd even thought about zombie worms until I turned up and handed out pills. Then Banana started to stand up again and they roped him to the front of the ute before he got it together and we force-fed him a pill. Prize bull, you know. Hence the name. It's... anatomical. Brain damage? Who knows. It doesn't matter anyhow, they want him to service cows, not their half-track. The kids have been having a lovely time carrying their slug guns around shooting down murder pigeons and using disposal as an excuse to build bonfires. 

Hettie the sow eventually made her way home to Janna, who greeted her like a lost child and promptly treated her for hydatids. One of the piglets survived, somehow, and it's back on mother's milk. Janna made enough from auctioning the empty Hummingbird to start rebuilding her nursery so we gave her the other five and helped with the building. Well, Oleksiy did, because he's a builder. Or was, at one point. I just carried stuff, and sometimes provided tools. And eventually burnt a few points to plumb sprinklers and restock the nursery.

When the first dog weeds appeared we let them feed and followed them back to the hives. They were older than the first, but not very well fed. This played heavily in our favour. Small and slow growing, pigeons, dog weeds and worms were all they could muster. Having found the hive, out came old faithful and FOOM! FOOM! FOOM! They say phosphorous is what the soil is missing in this country but it didn't seem to agree with the antithesis.

One hive was in the creek. That was a lot harder to destroy, I didn't want to make too much mess out of the landscape, but it dries up some years and the granite bed is igneous so why not... I love my SPANKr. With an earth-shattering kaboom, decomposed granite rattled off my visor from all directions, and suddenly I was very glad Trix insisted I wear it.

Some days I think I'm Autumn's assistant, not the other way round. My stipend is much higher than a normal Vanguard, because it's not a stipend, it's budget for arborculture and supporting activities. 

I could have just told them, the trees you want are ironbark and blackbutt. Ironbark is hard even on an Australian chainsaw. It  doesn't float and it takes thirty years for an untreated fencepost to rot. 

But that apparently, is anecdotal. We're going to DO SCIENCE, which means deliberately plant a hive in a stand of stringybark and time its attempts to consume them before annihilating the hive. Then we'll do the same with some ironbark. 

Autumn is very excited to run her own research project so that's what we're going to do. Her academic minions arrive in an uninspiring electric passenger van, wilt under my disapproving glare and scurry off to do scientific things.

What could _possibly_ go wrong?
