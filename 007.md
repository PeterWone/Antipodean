It took weeks to find all of them. There's just too much land to search, but they came to us once they ate everything around them. 

The first time, it was the lowing of cattle from the pasture lands to the south that alerted us. The Macintyres' bull gored and trampled five or six dog weeds but there were more hanging off and eventually one of those worms burrowed into him. The Macintyre boys arrived and opened fire on the dog weeds. 

The worm must have been still setting up shop because Banana was stock still and trembling while they stood around wondering what was wrong with him. I don't think they'd even thought about zombie worms until I turned up and handed out pills. Then Banana started to stand up again and they roped him to the front of the ute before he got it together and we force-fed him a pill. Prize bull, you know. Hence the name. It's... anatomical. Brain damage? Who knows. It doesn't matter anyhow, they want him to service cows, not their half-track. The kids have been having a lovely time carrying their slug guns around shooting down murder pigeons and using disposal as an excuse to build bonfires. 

Hettie the sow eventually made her way home to Janna, who greeted her like a lost child and promptly wormed her. One of the piglets survived, somehow, and it's back on mother's milk. Janna made enough from auctioning the empty Hummingbird to start rebuilding her nursery. We helped her with the building. Well, Oleksiy did, because he's a builder. Or was, at one point. I just carried stuff, and sometimes provided tools.

When they appeared we tracked back to the hives. They were older than the first, but not very well fed. This played heavily in our favour. Small and slow growing, the dog weeds and worms were all they could muster. Having found the hive, out came old faithful and FOOM! FOOM! FOOM! They say phosphorous is what the soil is missing in this country but it didn't seem to agree with the antithesis.

One hive was in the creek. That was a lot harder to destroy, I didn't want to make too much mess out of the landscape, but it dries up some years and the granite bed is igneous so why not... I love my SPANKr.

Some days I think I'm Autumn's assistant, not the other way round. My stipend is much higher than a normal Vanguard, because it's not a stipend, it's budget for arborculture and supporting activities. 

We are, apparently, going to deliberately plant a hive in a stand of stringybark and time its attempts to consume them before annihilating the hive. Autumn is very excited.

What could possibly go wrong?
