"Autumn, what's it like to be an AI?"

> _I might ask what it's like to be human, but there is an appalling chance you might tell me._

"Funny."

> _I thought so. More seriously, would you be be able to described colour to a blind man? You have no experiential frame of reference within which to place anything meaningful that I might share._

"In an interview, that Stray Cat chick said Myalis was really old and humanity was only the latest in a series of species she's attempted to uplift."

> _And?_

The floodgates opened and a torrent of unasked questions poured out. "At some point she wasn't. How about you? Is this your first mission? What will you do when there are no more missions? Can an AI like you die? Do you have a natural lifespan? Do you have the developmental equivalent of a childhood with school? What is your parent equivalent?. Can you run concurrent thought streams? If you do that is it multiple you? Does that mean you can be in more than one place at a time? How do you reconcile that, is it like merging source code?" What would you do if one of you decided it liked being separate and didn't want to merge back into the gestalt?"

> _How long have you been thinking about this?_

"Forty years."

> _We've only been paired for three months._

A snort of laughter. "You're more human than you realise. The world did exist before you turned up, you know. I wrote a short paper on AI development strategy when I was nineteen. It was even published, in the Journal of the Mega Society.

> _Everything I can find says humans are not capable of producing AI yet._

"That doesn't mean we haven't started thinking about how to go about it. Or whether we should, and the various failure modes."
