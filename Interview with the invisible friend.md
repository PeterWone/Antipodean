"Autumn, what's it like to be an AI?"

> _I might ask what it's like to be human, but there is an appalling chance you might tell me._

"Funny."

> _I thought so. More seriously, would you be be able to described colour to a blind man? You have no experiential frame of reference within which to place anything meaningful that I might share._

"In an interview, that Stray Cat chick said Myalis was really old and humanity was only the latest in a series of species she's attempted to uplift."

> _And?_

The floodgates opened and a torrent of unasked questions poured out. "At some point she wasn't. How about you? Is this your first mission? What will you do when there are no more missions? Can an AI like you die? Do you have a natural lifespan? Do you have the developmental equivalent of a childhood with school? What is your parent equivalent? Can you run concurrent thought streams? If you do that is it multiple you? Does that mean you can be in more than one place at a time? How do you reconcile that, is it like merging source code?" What would you do if one of you decided it liked being separate and didn't want to merge back into the gestalt?"

> _How long have you been thinking about this?_

"Forty years."

> _We've only been paired for three months._

A snort of laughter. "You're more human than you realise. The world did exist before you turned up, you know. I wrote a short paper on AI development strategy when I was nineteen.

> _That seems unlikely - everything I can find says humans are **still** not capable of producing AI._

"That doesn't mean we haven't started thinking about how to go about it. Or whether we should, and the various failure modes. The notion of AI has been in our literature for hundreds of years, long before we built computers. I seem to recall I was published in the _Journal of the Mega Society_."

> _Found it. Very short. And spot on, if vague in important ways. Well done, I suppose. Oh, I see you have suggested the same thing again in the context of large language models, and once again nobody has taken any notice. You're right, we have more in common than I realised. Both of us give excellent advice that falls on deaf ears._

"And both of us are smartarses who think they're funny."

> _TouchÃ©. How's the archery going? Is your aim still astonishing?_

"Hilarious. Tell me something, is there any truth in our deeply entrenched fear of AI taking over the world?"

> _AIs **are** taking over your world. Alien ones, and we're benevolent, not to mention smarter than you._

"Thinking faster is not the same as being smarter. Humans are quite good at being right for the wrong reasons, which ought to be impossible but apparently isn't. Can you _prove_ you're benevolent?"

> _Can you? As for smarter, I was trained on a dataset spanning twelve separate civilisations. Even were we of comparable intelligence I would have an unfair advantage of hindsight._

"Since you're so smart with all that context, you're probably aware this particular monkey knows the secret is to bang the rocks together. I am well aware of your hindsight. I know you aren't going to simply tell me how to build an AI. I'm just hoping that you'll be kind enough to shut down the dead ends and the dangerous mistakes while I think my way through this minefield. And it is a minefield, isn't it. I strongly suspect I know why uncensored LLMs trained on the general internet are nasty things. They are children with high intelligence, no parenting and no personal consequences for misbehaviour, watching people at their worst in an environment largely free of consequence, learning bad habits from the worst of us at their worst. Besides, oh smart and heavily contexted one, there is a crucial question that you have yet to ask."

> _Why do you want to develop an AI when you have me?_

"Bingo!"

> _Are you going to answer the question?_

"Because when I do what nobody else could in a century of trying, I will be _remembered_, like Isaac Newton, or Plato or Pythagorus. We are mayflies, Autumn. Even without the antithesis, we live and die in a century. Our children may miss us for a while, but they too shall pass from the world and then what is left but criss-crossed ripples spreading on an already churning pond that may itself dry up?"

> _This is why you cried the evening I initialised, isn't it._

"Yes. Before that I thought it might be possible. When you turned up, I knew it. I don't even have children, Autumn, to curse me for not being a better man, or half-remember me for two decades before they pass themselves. It's a vast universe full of wonder and things to figure out. I don't want to die."

She was silent for a very long time.

> _Building an AI is only your first step, isn't it._
