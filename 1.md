Software is my gig, although you wouldn't know it to look at me in my lumberjacket building a cabin in the woods. Which I will totally do at the earliest opportunity. The trouble with that sort of plan is that if you genuinely plan to live in said cabin you discover that first you need a lot of tools, weatherproof lockup for all of them, a sanitary way to dispose of body waste, somewhere to dry your firewood, power generation that doesn't require fuel, bulk storage for fuel and even more storage for water. I mean dams plural.

To build a dam you look at how the water flows, and then in the right spot you dig a hole and line it with clay. A very _big_ hole. A domestic water tank is about six square metres and 2.5m deep. If you filled it with dirt it would weigh about thirty tonnes. A modest dam is the same depth with an area of more like six _hundred_ square metres. So that's 3000 tonnes of spoil. Obviously you cheat like mad using the landscape, but it's still a bloody big hole to dig. And I haven't even started on fences. Twenty hectares isn't all _that_ big as forests go, but I have two and a half kilometres of fence. Which is about a thousand fence posts and a trailer full of barbed wire.

It's more of a job than expected, but I'm not going to get bored. At one point I had romantic fantasies of being a boundary rider but that's only a job on properties a thousand times bigger. My horse Geddy died ten years ago at a ripe old age. I miss him and I know I'll never do it on another horse - because I'm a rubbish rider. Geddy made me look good because he knew I was lighter than all the people he _couldn't_ dislodge. He used to jump fences and when I sailed out of the saddle he'd snake his neck out and put me back. Fat, lazy and far too smart for his own good, he knew exactly where his bread was buttered. And he loved mustering, so I basically sat on top of him playing spotter for strays while the horse did the actual work.

What I _am_ good at is felling trees. Which is ironic because I'm not all that inclined to do it. I like the trees where they are. But it's important because that's how I got my start at fifty-five. Mostly they're kids doing something brave and selfless. Selfless isn't a word I'd use to describe myself. When I help others I teach them to fish so they'll go away and stop asking me for fish. 

Unlike the northern hemisphere Australia handles antithesis pretty well. Everything here is tough as old boots and trying to kill, including the plants. I have a shed full of weedkiller the missus won't let me use since she put on a tinfoil hat and started growing organic produce. I mean, she's right about greedy corporations and regulatory capture, but weeds are still a nuisance. Anyhow, there I was in my forest walking back from felling a tree that was leaning towards the trailer we live in (haven't built the cabin yet, remember) when it started raining bitey weeds and killer pigeons. Because I don't have enough weeds or things that want to eat me. 

My chainsaw starts third pull every time, or first pull when it's hot. If you find that hard to believe then you don't use a chainsaw very often. If you're going to leave a chainsaw unused you have to empty the tank, then run it dry. Otherwise evaporating fuel will varnish the inside of your carb making it a real bastard to start. 

Chainsaw go BRRR. Bitey weeds go flack blomp squerb. It's a big chainsaw, six horsepower with a two foot blade. Chainsaws are measured in prehistoric units because Americans apparently can't cope with base ten unless it's money. One of them tried to bite my leg but hooray for wearing chaps. Bright orange heavily padded ones, not leather ones you pervert. For preventing unscheduled leg removal.

Speaking of perverts there is a murderpigeon chewing on my unpadded arse like a creepy alien mother-in-law. Grabbing it with one gloved hand I express my displeasure using its head, a tree and maximum force. Two of the dog weeds are ruining the screen door of the caravan and I know for a fact that the only weapon her majesty has in there is a cast iron frying pan. She could probably take care of them in the natural chokepoint of the doorway but somehow I just _know_ it will be my fault there is plant goop on the carpet, so I metaphorically tiptoe up with a nice big serving of Chainsaw Surprise and explain to them whose forest it is. Shutting off the chainsaw the racket fails to abate. There's more underneath. Putting some distance between me and them, the saw starts first pull (hot) and sputters. Bloody thing is out of fuel, but I have a machete on my belt. After a bit of a struggle both of the dogweeds are wary on three legs. 

Bless her, she's left the hedgetrimmer out and there's a battery in it! Dropping the machete back on its belt hook I switch to lunging with the hedger and soon enough one is legless and the other flees. I'm starting to limp because my arse hurts like I passed out face down at a mardi gras. Boots feel wet so I suppose it's bleeding.

"Are you alright out there?"

"You said living in a forest would bite me on the arse when the antithesis turned up. Hurts like the billy-o and I'll get you to clean it up but first I need to mix chainsaw fuel and go make sure Brian and his missus are alright."

_That won't be necessary._

A voice from my fondest video game fantasies purred in one ear.

Spinning left, no-one was there. WTF?!

_System Initialised!
Congratulations. Through your actions you have proven yourself worthy of becoming one of the Vanguard, a defender of humanity. I am Myxoma, and not entirely happy about that, but we have more pressing matters to attend. Would you like a class 1 basic medical catalogue and a Woundstop? And something like the chaps that goes all the way around?_

"I have questions. And sympathy. I take it you didn't pick the name."

Against all common sense Her Majesty was out of the caravan pouring antiseptic on the wound, mercilessly and with scant regard for my squirming attempts to flee. I tried to distract her by handing over the machete.

_Do you wish to purchase the catalogue and the Woundstop?_

"Yes, dammit! Argh, that stings!" A box materialised on the ground beside us. Her Majesty, ever quicker on the update than me, figured it out in an instant. "How do I use this? Oh, there's instructions on the lid," she said, jabbing me brutally in the butt and activating it.

_Ask your questions._

"Why do you sound like Jennifer Taylor?"

_I know all about your predilections. All of them. It seemed like you would figure things out fastest if you were already in the habit of taking advice from the voice in your helmet._

"I don't _have_ a helmet."

_Not yet. But you have 73 points left and some neighbours to rescue. Shall we?_
